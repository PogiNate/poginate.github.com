  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/vp_icon.png" title="VoodooPad Icon" alt="The VoodooPad Icon" />
I’ve <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">mentioned before</a> that I go through three phases as I get used to a new program: <em>Inquiry</em>, <em>Inquisition</em> and <em>Investment</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Inquiry</em> phase is the “does it do what I want it to do, without being irritating?” phase. Basically this is like a caveman poking a thing with a sharp stick, hiding behind a rock to see if it tries to bite him, then biting <em>it</em> to see if it’s worth eating.</p>

  <p>If a program gets past that, then comes the <em>Inquisition</em>: “Oh yeah, well can you handle <em>this</em>? What about <em>that</em>? And how do you like the <em>comfy chair</em>?”</p>

  <p>Anything that makes it past the Inquisition with any level of approval gets my <em>Investment</em>, the phase where I put the time into learning how to use the program to its fullest and really start using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve put VoodooPad through the wringer before. Searching through my email reveals that I have a version 2 license<sup id="fnref:password"><a href="#fn:password" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I liked the idea, the core of VoodooPad back then, but it never got past the Inquisition. I could see that it <em>wanted</em> to do things right, but we never <em>clicked</em>. </p>

<p>Still, when I got the email that VoodooPad had left its original home at Flying Meat I was kinda saddened. It may not have been my cup of tea, but it was still an amazing product and it’s cool in a way that is hard to put into words. Don’t get me wrong, I think Gus of Flying Meat made the right choice when he decided to <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2013/11/a_new_home_for_voodoopad.html">sell VoodooPad</a>. If he doesn’t feel he can maintain it any more nobody would know better than he would. </p>

<p>The new owners at <a href="https://plausible.coop/">Plausible Labs</a> have promised to make it better and take great care of it, because they love VoodooPad and want to see it grow. That’s great news. </p>

<p>But can I trust it?</p>

<p>There’s two questions there: Can I trust Plausible Labs to keep making VoodooPad better, and can I trust VoodooPad to be good enough to deserve my investment?</p>

<p>For the record I’ve already purchased my license; so we’re not talking about <em>financial</em> investment. I’m talking about investing my time, which is far more valuable these days. (“oh, look at Mr. Moneybags!” Yeah, yeah, you know what I meant.)</p>

<p>So, second question first: Can I trust VoodooPad, the program, to be what I want it to be?</p>

<h2 id="trusting-the-program">Trusting the Program</h2>

<p>This is the bigger of the two questions. After all, if VoodooPad is good enough to use and invest in now it doesn’t need a lot of updates all the time. My beloved Scrivener gets (I would say) <em>Just enough</em> updates: Not every month, but every so often. And even if updates stopped tomorrow I would keep using it until it no longer worked on whatever Mac I was using in the far future. </p>

<p>So I’ve started the process. I would say I’m near the end of the Inquisition phase right now. And what I’ve found is hopeful. Coming to version 5 of VoodooPad from version 2 left me refreshingly free of preconceived notions about the program: I knew it was a “Personal Wiki” and that’s about it. </p>

<p>Markdown support has entered the mix since last I checked the app, and even better, it seems to fully understand MultiMarkdown<sup id="fnref:mmd"><a href="#fn:mmd" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is a huge win. Simple Markdown like headings, strong, italic, etc. are all handled correctly and shown while you’re editing the text. </p>

<p>The other <em>sine qua non</em> for a personal wiki that I had is inter-page links that just <em>appear</em> without any additional markup/markdown/whatever. When I type the name of another page I want it to be clickable. VoodooPad does that with aplomb. </p>

<p>So, as a personal wiki it’s doing what I want it to do. <em>Check</em>. </p>

<p>And there’s a lot more that I haven’t fully explored yet<sup id="fnref:investment"><a href="#fn:investment" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, like in-app scripting in Python, JSTalk, Ruby, shell, etc. and other potentially useful things like tagging, collections, built-in todo list collection…it’s basically the kitchen sink. </p>

<p>But there’s one huge dark spot: the iOS version of the app. It’s definitely been lacking in love or attention for years now. It’s not iOS 7-compiled, and most of the UI looks more like iOS 4. It doesn’t seem to open my main document, and it has separate editing/reading modes, thus getting rid of the main good thing I see in the desktop version. But, again, Plausible promises that improvments are coming. Which leads us to the second point: Trusting the company.</p>

<h2 id="trusting-plausible-labs">Trusting Plausible Labs</h2>

<p>This is where I have a bigger problem. It’s not that I think they’re incompetent, or lazy, or bad developers or anything. Just as I believe Gus knew when to get out of VoodooPad, I also believe that he didn’t hand it over to someone who would mess it up. But it’s not their baby. </p>

<p>I’m not saying I think they’ll let it languish, but they need to know that now is a very sensitive period for the product. They shouldn’t rush any bug fixes or new features just for the sake of putting out a new version, but semi-regular updates on the blog about how the work is coming, some notification that they <em>are</em> working on it would go a long way to build confidence.<sup id="fnref:clockwork"><a href="#fn:clockwork" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>That said, I’m going to <em>Invest</em>-with-a-capital-I in VoodooPad. And I great hopes of seeing Plausible Labs do great things with it. I just hope we don’t have to wait too long. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 1998 I served an <a href="http://mormon.org/values/missionary-work">LDS Mission</a> to the Philippines. Those of you who are familiar with how LDS missionaries operate know the drill: you spend ten weeks learning the language in a classroom setting and then you get sent out with a more experienced missionary to try it on your own. And anyone who has ever tried to speak a language they’ve only heard in a classroom setting knows what comes next: you spend a lot of time staring at people who speak a language you thought you were pretty good at, and you have no idea what they’re saying. </p>

<p>So I set myself some goals. I wanted to laugh at a Tagalog joke, because I actually understood it. I wanted to get my accent to be less terrible<sup id="fnref:accent"><a href="#fn:accent" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I wanted to actually think in Tagalog. These were little stepping stones I set for myself, goals I was trying to reach to show that I was actually gaining some actual fluency in the language. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="&#8220;Kaya ko ito!&#8221;">
And then, one night a few months after I landed in Manila I had a thought, just three words that came to me as I was walking across the town square: “Kaya ko ito!” That was it. In English<sup id="fnref:sorta"><a href="#fn:sorta" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it’s “I can do this”.  But that’s not the point. The point was that I had the thought <em>in Tagalog</em> instead of having it in English and translating it. I had a long way to go, but it was clear that something was happening, and I was learning something. Since then that thought has come back to me from time to time when I’m trying to do something difficult. I’ll start in one something, bang my head against the wall for a while, and all of a sudden there will be a moment of clarity, a brief glimpse of the summit after the first day’s climb, and the words “Kaya ko ito” will come back into my head. I can do this.
</span></p>

<p>One of those difficult things has been learning vim. While I’ve been teaching myself to use it<sup id="fnref:painlessplug"><a href="#fn:painlessplug" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I’ve had a lot of moments where it just seemed too hard, too useless, and I had to set myself some goals. They were simpler goals, things like “don’t lose half a file and have to restore it from my git backups again today”, and then more useful goals, like “actually use the search and replace engine,” followed shortly by “actually use vim’s regex engine without the <code>very magic</code> flag”. Litte steps to show that I was making progress. </p>

<p>And one day, just a little while ago, I had a simple task ahead of me: remove the last three arguments from a function declaration. Without really thinking about it I got my cursor inside the parentheses and since my cursor was just before the closing paren I typed</p>

<pre><code>d3F,
</code></pre>

<p>And that was it. In English<sup id="fnref:kinda"><a href="#fn:kinda" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> it’s “delete back through the third comma before the cursor”. But that’s not the point. The point is that I just <em>did</em> it, without looking at a cheat sheet, without using help, without standing there for two minutes trying to figure out how to do what I knew I wanted to do. It was the “Kaya kong ito” moment all over again. I know I’ve still got a lot of vim to learn, but it’s clear that something is happening, and I’m learning something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year marks my sixth year participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, and I’ve started wondering if there was really a <em>point</em> to writing a “novel” in a single month. Especially since I haven’t really developed any of them beyond the rough draft I wrote in November. </p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/nano_win.png" title="National Novel Writing Month Winner" alt="National Novel Writing Month Winner" /> So, I “won” again this year, writing a book that I have absolutely no desire to pursue further. Which has made me wonder if I’m doing it wrong or if I need to maybe just give up on NaNoWriMo because it’s not helping me grow as a “real” writer. But then I realized something.</p>

<p>I never would have written <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em> if I hadn’t been taking part of NaNoWriMo every year. <em>Painless Vim</em> isn’t a novel, it’s not a wild flight of fancy that I pounded out in a month.<sup id="fnref:supposed"><a href="#fn:supposed" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  But there are a lot of things I learned from NaNoWriMo that made it possible for me to write <em>Painless Vim</em>. Some of the most important are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Write every day. This is the first and only secret of writing, of course. </li>
  <li>Write your first draft like nobody is going to read it, because nobody <em>is</em> going to read it. You’ll revise it into something better. </li>
  <li>Write for yourself. There are others out there who are in the same place as you, and they’ll appreciate what you’ve written. </li>
  <li>Use Scrivener. <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">I absolutely <em>love</em> Scrivener</a>, and six years of NaNo’ing has made it as comfortable as a well-worn pair of blue jeans for me. If I get up the energy I’ll write a post about how my Scrivener workflow looks one of these days. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I’m not saying that I’m the world’s best author. But I wrote a book and put it out there where people can buy it, which is something that never would have happened if it hadn’t been for National Novel Writing Month. And that’s enough to keep me coming back year after year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the best study of my main character, the one that I think most accurately captures who she thinks she is. </p>

<hr />

<p>The roadway sparkles and flows with light, a jeweled strand across the dark landscape. Cylee sat far up on a hill, the fresh, wild wind blowing her hair back. </p>

<p>She used to live in this place, this quiet, dark, outdoor world. Back before Pacifica, before the war…</p>

<p>The strings of lights eventually merge into the cities, connecting the nets of lights that represent civilization, mankind’s crowning jewels shining in the dark. And once you’re caught in that net it can feel like there’s nothing else, no other way to live. You can learn to depend on the Network, constant wireless streams of information flowing into and out of you at all times. You can learn to read the streets as you read the trees, feel the way the social wind is blowing just as you used to know how to read the fitful pre-dawn breezes. </p>

<p>And, in truth, Cylee was caught by that net. If she stayed out here for a few days or weeks her Spine would shut down and go from being an Augmentation to being thirty pounds of stiff dead metal. She’d be essentially blinded and deafened, her limbs left to their own strength. Even now she was half blind, her Spine out of range of the Network and therefore unable to give her the kind of information that made up the background noise of her daily life. Granted, she could still see every living, warm blooded thing that moved in the darkness, every rabbit, every bat, every bird was a blip on her augmented vision, their insane heart rates pounding like miniature thunder in her ears. </p>

<p>But she used to track them unaided. Used to be able to sense the movement of creatures that were string to remain hidden. She could feel the twitch in the grass that didn’t <em>quite</em> match the way the wind was moving. And she would raise her bow quietly, wait for the next movement…and…with a soft twang she would have breakfast.</p>

<p>Out of a sense of irony and frustration she considered raising her flechette thrower and pinning that rabbit to the ground, letting her Spine handle the fine details of getting her hand in the right position, but she stopped, realized she didn’t need the meat, and shouldn’t waste it. Pacifica had made her a perfect soldier, but it hadn’t entirely removed the true hunter she had been. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There’s a saying about marriage that you should find a spouse with your eyes wide open and stay with a spouse with your eyes half shut.<sup id="fnref:source"><a href="#fn:source" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve found this to be helpful advice about more than just marriage; when I buy a new computer I spend months reading reviews and write ups on the all the components involved and scouring the world for the best prices. Once I buy my components I all but block those sites on my browser; I don’t <em>want</em> to know that a brand new video card came out the same day my suddenly obsolete one arrives at my door. I just want to be happy with what I bought.</p>

<p>And, in an odd way it’s turning out to be true about writing <em><a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>. There are two books and a few websites that I used quite a bit while I was starting to learn vim, they are somehow on my “okay” list. But any site or book I haven’t read yet is now <em>the enemy</em>, because I’m afraid they’re all better than the book I’m writing and I’ll have to die now. There are (at least) <a href="https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro">two</a> <a href="https://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway">other</a> vim books already on Leanpub.com; I can’t look at them too directly lest I discover the only thing my book has that the don’t is a whimsical cover. </p>

<p>And, of course, what does it matter? If other books are better that’s fine; I can hope that there are some people out there who will get what they need out of my little book. So I’m keeping my head in the sand a little bit. Some day I’ll be done writing <em>Painless Vim</em> and I’ll be able to read other people’s vim books.</p>

<p>There’s no real point here; just a little note about how my mind seems to work when I’m mid-book like this.</p>

This is a super-short post to show off what I&rsquo;m going to be working on for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> this year. </p>

<p>I know that <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/">Painless Vim</a></em> isn&rsquo;t finished yet, although it&rsquo;s very close, and basically all I&rsquo;m doing is a little bit of cleanup and formatting. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting with baited breath for <em>Painless Vim</em> to be finished fear not! I will still be working on the Little Vim Book that Could during the month of November. In fact, my goal is to have it completely finished. By December 1st, even while I&rsquo;m &ldquo;winning&rdquo; NaNoWriMo for the sixth straight year. </p>

<p>In previous years I&rsquo;ve been doing graduate level classes, having babies<sup id="fnref:babies"><a href="#fn:babies" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and changing jobs during NaNoWriMo, and I&rsquo;ve always found time to make it work. What&rsquo;s more, the impetus it gives me tends to help me get more done in the rest of my life as well. The saying about giving work to busy people still holds true. If I turn myself into a busy person I tend to be more capable overall. Until I freak out and melt down, of course. So I guess there&rsquo;s still something to be said for balance. </p>

<h2 id="more-about-pacifica">More About Pacifica</h2>

<p>Which is all very nice, but you may possibly be interested in the book cover I&rsquo;m showing off here. You&rsquo;ve got questions, no doubt. Questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who designed your cover?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you be willing to let me redesign your cover, because it&rsquo;s pretty bad?&rdquo; </p>

<p>The answers are &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute&rdquo;, &ldquo;I did in about two hours using Pixelmator&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in that order. I like playing with Pixelmator, but I&rsquo;m not super great with it, and if there&rsquo;s a graphic designer out there who wants to take a second pass at this I&rsquo;d be happy to let you. </p>

<p>The book is my first foray into cyberpunk. It&rsquo;s a near-future look at what&rsquo;s its like to be on the losing side of a war for independence, and how to keep your pride even when you&rsquo;ve got nothing left to be proud of. </p>

<p>If I remember (and have time) I&rsquo;ll probably post excerpts through the month. Wether or not I actually develop <em>Pacifica</em> after November remains to be seen, but if I&rsquo;ve learned anything from five successful NaNo&rsquo;s its that even writing an ultimately wasted story isn&rsquo;t wasted effort. I&rsquo;ve learned something from every book I&rsquo;ve written.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/nvALT.png" title="nvALT icon" />
One of the best things about <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> is that it gives you a lot of tools you can use with little to no friction. You can use tags, or not, you can store your files in dropbox as individual markdown files, or you can keep them all in a single database<sup id="fnref:database"><a href="#fn:database" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s all up to you. It&rsquo;s very liberal about how you use its powers.</p>

<p>Which means I missed one.</p>

<p>Up until now I&rsquo;ve been using nvALT as my repository of code and notes on projects, useful tips and hints and things that I tend to forget. You know, all the stuff that makes nvALT great. The praises of nvALT have already been sung, and sung better than I will sing them here. But here&rsquo;s what I just discovered: the inter-note linking feature. </p>

<p><strong>OH. MAN.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, those of you who already knew about this can just go ahead and laugh at me. But for those of you who haven&rsquo;t discovered this yet, it&rsquo;s very very simple and powerful. Just wrap the name of another note in <code>[[double brackets]]</code> and you have a link to that note. What&rsquo;s more, once you open the double brackets you can start typing the name of a file and nvALT will autocomplete it for you.</p>

<p>With this addition, nvALT has supplanted VoodooPad, EverNote, and my <a href="https://github.com/PogiNate/SublimeWiki">own home-brew Sublime Text Wiki system</a>. Not only is it more flexible, but it also has one of the best built-in markdown previews ever. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/SW2-icon.jpg" title="&#34;Small World 2 App Icon&#34;" alt="&#34;Small World 2 App Icon&#34;" />
Just a quick post to happily note that <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com">Days of Wonder</a> has finally updated their <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/small-world-for-ipad/id364165557?mt=8">Small World app</a> on the iPad. Small World was the first game I bought on the original iPad, and it&rsquo;s been sadly neglected for a quite a while. </p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s back in business now! It&rsquo;s beautifully, fully retina, has new content (available through an in app purchase), and now lets you play with up to five people via pass &amp; play, or you can have the one on one experience that you&rsquo;re used to from the original version. I&rsquo;ve always loved Days Of Wonder&rsquo;s games, and they continue to do a great job bringing them to the iPad. Thanks guys!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife and I love board games. So it’s only natural that our kids will love them as well. And that’s <em>awesome</em>. But since all of our kids are under nine years old playing games with them can be a bit of a headache, because they don’t really have a sense of how losing one tiny little piece can ruin a sixty dollar game, and pieces are really small and easily lost. </p>

<p>Enter the iPad. I bought the tablet version of SmallWorld back when I had a 1st Gen iPad, and while it’s fun, at the time my wife and I only used it to pass time when we were waiting for a table at a restauraunt or whatever. Since then I have also picked up Ticket to Ride and Forbidden Island, and my kids and I spent most of this weekend playing all three games over and over and <em>over</em> again, as kids are wont to do. </p>

<p>And it was a pretty amazing experience. I still love my “real” board games, for a number of reasons: the artwork is bigger, you get a tactile sense of what you’re doing, the experience is more immersive, and you can see the board from more than two feet away, etc. etc. </p>

<p>But when you’re playing with a passel of excitable kiddos there’s a lot to be said for keeping the iPad firmly in my hands as they all take their turns, get excited by the (usually quite minimal) resulting animations, and go dance around the room for a while. When the game is over I just close the cover and the game is packed up, no cleanup required. </p>

<p>A quick note about animations: If you’re doing a straight up port of your board game don’t try to make it a full-on video game. Take a look at <em>Ticket to Ride</em> by Days of Wonder and stick to that level: make your graphics and chrome beautiful, but let’s keep it a board game.</p>

<p>The other advantage is price. Since all I’m getting is a pile o’ bytes I don’t have to pay for a bunch of die cut custom printed cardboard pieces, which usually translates into around a 75% savings or better. The companies usually have a lot of high-quality assets all ready for the games, since you can and should use the same art for the digital and analog versions, so the R&amp;D costs are apparently low enough to make it worth doing. </p>

<p>Of course, in my situation this generally means I’m buying a game 1.25 times instead of 2 times, but hey, it’s still a savings. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Edward Snowden basically only verified what we had all already feared: The government is getting information about all of us behind our backs. The problem is that all this time Google has been promising that they’re doing a nice, open, transparent operation, letting us all know what they’re being asked for and what they’re actually giving, and now…well, I have a hard time believing them. </p>

<p>But it’s more than that. The old wisdom about eggs and numbers of baskets used to store them rings very true these days. Regardless of government requests<sup id="fnref:no_hide"><a href="#fn:no_hide" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, regardless of anything else, I’ve gradually become uncomfortable letting google moderate all aspects of my online life. </p>

<p>So I’m trying to move away from services that I’ve been using for  years. And the sad fact is that the alternatives just <em>aren’t</em> as good as the Google offerings. There’s no getting around it. But here’s what I’m using in my attempt at going Google-free:</p>

<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>

<p>Back to the fox. Firefox was once a shining star of the future of the web and now it’s kind of like Safari: At least it’s not Internet Explorer. But it has plugins like AdBlock Plus <sup id="fnref:block_comments"><a href="#fn:block_comments" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and <a href="http://www.abine.com/how-donottrackme-works/">Do Not Track Me</a>, both of which make it easier to keep anybody from following me around on the internet. Again, if they want to know where I go all day every day they can just <em>ask</em> me (or look at my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:PogiNate">Pinboard</a>), but I’d like them to have the decency to ask.</p>

<h2 id="duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</h2>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> is a great search engine for people who don’t want to be tracked. It stores exactly <em>nothing</em> about you, meaning your searches aren’t tailored or customized based on your past search history. They have a great summary of <a href="http://donttrack.us/">why this is a good thing</a> linked to their home page.</p>

<p>The downside is that, well, you’re not getting customized results, which means that sometimes you have to dig a few pages down to get the content you really want. But the results are quite good and getting better daily. </p>

<h2 id="gmail">Gmail…</h2>

<p>This is the one that’s going to be difficult. Gmail is the king of free email, bar none. To get anywhere close to the feature set that gmail provides is going to require paying for email, and if I’m going to do that I’d like to pay for really <em>really</em> secure email. So I’m still looking for a good replacement. </p>

<p>At first I was put off by the really small quotas most email providers give you. I mean, Gmail is up to 15GB free! A lot of them charge you for anything over 1GB! <strong>GASP!!</strong></p>

<p>But then I looked at my actual usage. I’ve had my gmail account for around 7 years, and I’ve used about .56GB. Yep. Half a gig.<sup id="fnref:inboxZero"><a href="#fn:inboxZero" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> So I’m probably okay on that front. Based on that I’m looking at a few options:</p>

<p>-<strong><a href="http://lavabit.com/index.html">Lavabit</a></strong> is an email provider who values security, security, security. For $8 a year you get 1GB of storage <sup id="fnref:upgrade"><a href="#fn:upgrade" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and <a href="http://lavabit.com/secure.html">totally encrypted email</a>. The price is good, and as I’ve said, I think I can swing a single gigabyte. 
- <strong><a href="https://www.hushmail.com/services/hushmail/features/">Hushmail</a></strong> Gives you PGP signed email…if you are sending to people who know how to open PGP encrypted email. They charge $34.99/year for 1GB of storage, but if you want to use a desktop email client via POP/IMAP you will have to go up to $49.98/year for some reason. 
- <strong><a href="https://www.fastmail.fm/signup/personal.html">FastMail</a></strong> is owned by <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> and is somewhere between Lavabit and Hushmail: it’s $19.95/year for 1GB, no mention of encryption on the server, but fully secure communication between client and server, and no (known) agreement with the NSA. </p>

<h2 id="duckduckgo-xmpp">DuckDuckGo XMPP</h2>

<p>Apparently Google is ending support for the XMPP protocol for Gtalk, which makes it a much less useful chat system. Which is a shame, because a lot of my coworkers use it almost exclusively. </p>

<p>But DuckDuckGo is there for you in this arena as well. They provide <a href="https://dukgo.com/blog/xmpp-services-at-duckduckgo">an XMPP server </a>that is much less Stalker-ish than GTalk, and also isn’t being deprecated in favor of closed protocols.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Google has done a good job of making themselves incredibly useful, and they make some very good apps. In the end it’s a question of how much you’re willing to give them in exchange for those services. I’d still like to believe that Google hasn’t totally abandoned their “Don’t Be Evil” mantra, but it’s still a good idea to check out the competition.  </p>
