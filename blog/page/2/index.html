  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/painless_cover.png" title="Painless Vim Cover" />
I&rsquo;m excited to announce the availability of <em>Painless Vim</em>, my new (indeed, still in progress) book on the ever powerful vim editor! While the book is still in progress, you can pick up a copy at <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Leanpub</a> right now and make suggestions to help guide the development of this book. I&rsquo;m very impressed by the Leanpub system, allowing authors to write their books out in the open and get feedback along the way. </p>

<h2 id="why-another-vim-tutorial">Why Another Vim Tutorial?</h2>

<p>I started thinking about writing this book when I realized I <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">wasn&rsquo;t the only developer</a> who has tried to use vim and was put off by the vast majority of vim training available. Vim is really very developer friendly, but a lot of the teaching resources for vim are anything but. My goal is to take the best of what I have picked up in my journey to vim and present it in a way that helps other people get over the initial hurdle and into the good parts of the editor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing quite a bit about the development process of the book and the workflow involved. Watch this space!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I’m presenting this as a <em>movie plot</em>, not <em>actual science</em>. I’m a programmer, not a physicist. I’m fully aware that I have no idea how physics works and that everything below is probably complete nonsense. Which is why it would be perfect for Hollywood. Okay, carry on. </p>

<p>So, here’s the premise: Light moves at, well, light speed. The closer you get to moving at light speed, the slower subjective time moves. Which means that for light, time doesn’t move <em>at all</em>. Which is probably part of why it’s both photons (particles) and light waves (energy); if there’s no time there is no significant difference between the two.<sup id="fnref:relax"><a href="#fn:relax" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Okay, so here’s the sci-fi movie upshot of all this, using a lot of tech wizardry that makes very little sense: A scientist discovers a way to entangle photons, so that when you send a concentrated beam of photons out the state of each emitted photon is mirrored in a trapped photon. (Remember: this is <strong>movie science</strong>, not real science) the kicker is that the state of the emitted photon is identical to the trapped photon until it hits something, which is when it starts experiencing non-light-speed time again, and is <em>also</em> useful because light, moving at light speed doesn’t experience subjective time at all, so the moment when it strikes something, even if that is far in the (observer’s subjective) future, is reflected in the trapped photon <em>instantly</em>. By reading the state of your trapped photons, you can observe events in more-or-less real time by using a really powerful computer, probably with code scrolling across its screen at all times.</p>

<p>Now we mix in the science magic that non-scientific people call “quantum” and we assume that you can interpolate details about the surroundings of the emitted photon from its state when it strikes something and viola! You’ve invented a way to look forward in time. By bouncing the photon off of things at various distances from the earth (reflection doesn’t cause the photon to resolve its state because shut up) you can observe future conditions at various points in the future. And thus quasi-scientific movie magic is born. </p>

<p>From here you can do various things with explorations of the deterministic nature of the universe, either saying that everything remains the same no matter what you try to do to change them (essentially turning light into a sci-fi version of the Oracle at Delphi) or you can have the light beams show that individual changes can alter the course of history. Or for even more fun you can throw some vaguely understood concepts about the act of observation changing that which is observed and say that us spying on the future is itself changing the future. The fact that we’re also changing that future’s past only serves to further complicate the relationship between the two events. </p>

<p>And then, as the final twist (or material for the sequel) you can reveal that the future is using the same light beams to spy on <em>us</em>. </p>

<p>Any major movie studios wishing to do a plot treatment can leave a comment below. I’m reasonable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been using <a href="https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator">Tmuxinator</a> for a while now to put together tmux sessions that I can run quickly and easily from the command line. I’ve even set up an <a href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/04/12/introducing-a-dot-k-a-dot-the-alias-manager/">AKA</a> shortcut, abbreviating <code>tmuxinator</code> to <code>tor</code>, making it much easier to create new scripted sessions. But recently I discovered an odd thing when I detached from a session created by tmuxinator: they don’t show up in my list of sessions when I run <code>tmux ls</code>. </p>

<p>So I played with it a bit more. I could run <code>tor config1</code> and get a session laid out according to configuration 1. I’d then detach and create a session by hand, and do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ tmux new -s bar -d
$ tmux ls
bar: 1 windows (created Thu May 9 07:35:02) [160x39]
</code></pre>

<p>Well that’s odd. So I’d try </p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -t config1
</code></pre>

<p>and it would say it can’t find the session.  Out of curiosity (did I kill the session instead of just detaching?) I’d run </p>

<pre><code>tor config1
</code></pre>

<p>again, and I would be back in my already-running session.</p>

<p>Okay, most of you have already gotten here ahead of me. When you run Tmuxinator it’s issuing commands from ruby, not from your user session. The tmux process that ruby uses is a child process of ruby, not of your shell. This is fine if you create all your sessions from Tmuxinator, but if you start standing up impromptu sessions just because, or if you have decided to have tmux start whenever your terminal opens it means that your Tmuxinator sessions and your non-Tmuxinator sessions are on totally different servers, so you can’t use <code>&lt;prefix&gt;)</code> to switch between them.</p>

<p>So I decided to bite the bullet and move my Tmuxinator sessions over to independently executable scripts. It’s more steps, not quite as pretty, but the commands are all sensible, and now sessions I create using my scripts are visible on my “main” tmux server. And I’m free of one more external dependency, which is nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/">Timbuk2</a> bag that I purchased six years ago, when I got my first MacBook. Even though I only had a 13” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MacBook.jpg">black plastic MacBook</a> at the time, I got the 15” messenger bag because I figured the odds were pretty good that <em>someday</em> I would have a 15” MacBook Pro. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="But other than a bit of dirt the bag still looks pretty much as good as it did when I bought it."> 
The 13” MacBook is gone, one 15” MBP has come and gone and a new one now lives in the same pocket of the same messenger bag I picked up all those years ago. That bag has been through airports, camping trips, freezing terrible outdoor IT jobs in the dead of winter and hot terrible outdoor IT jobs in the dog days of summer. Now it’s pretty much relegated to hauling my computer back and forth to and from the office because I’ve left my IT days behind me.  But other than a bit of dirt the bag still looks pretty much as good as it did when I bought it. The seams are still tight and solid, the velcro still works, the material is still without any frayed or torn spots. The bag cost more than I could afford at the time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I’ve never regretted the decision.  I got something that was well made, and I’m grateful. 
</span> </p>

<p>So, not a big post, or a deep important mystery of life this time around, sorry. Not even a cool new tech toy to play with. My only real point is that if you do some research and find something worth investing in<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> you will be rewarded for it. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I usually work plugged into power and a monitor and all that good stuff, there are times where my MacBook Pro and I need to go off the grid for a while. During those times I’ve found that it’s easiest to have a terminal window fullscreen and do everything via the command line. That way I don’t really need a mouse at all and I can keep my hands on the keyboard doing whatever it is I’m doing that day. If I need any of my GUI apps <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is always right there to help me out, again, without using the trackpad. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="let&#8217;s be honest: This entire project came about simply because I wanted to add some graphics to tmux.">
The one <sup id="fnref:minor"><a href="#fn:minor" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> problem is that when an app is full screen you can’t see your battery percentage, and it’s possible to actually run yourself out of power without really knowing how close you are. Okay, I admit that it’s a minor problem, and highly unlikely. So let’s be honest: This entire project came about simply because I wanted to add some graphics to tmux. Ever since I learned you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Color_Emoji">Apple’s Color Emoji</a> set in terminal windows I’ve been looking for even a semi-useful way to do so. 
</span></p>

<p>What inspired me was a little section at the end of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">Brian Hogan’s tmux book</a> about adding battery status to your status bar at the bottom of tmux windows. He links to <a href="https://raw.github.com/richoH/dotfiles/master/bin/battery">a script</a> that works cross platform, but that’s not really what I wanted. As Steve Jobs once said, if you’re working cross platform, you’re not getting the most out of your specific platform<sup id="fnref:kinda"><a href="#fn:kinda" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. So I decided to write my own script.</p>

<p>doing a little bit of searching revealed this lovely command that appears to be OSX specific:</p>

<pre><code>pmset -g batt
</code></pre>

<p>running this will give you a result like this:</p>

<pre><code>Currently drawing from 'Battery Power'
  -InternalBattery-0     100%; discharging; 6:44 remaining
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this string is just begging to be pulled apart via regular expressions. So that’s exactly what I did. The first line is super easy to parse; there are only two possible strings (as near as I can tell) that go between the single quotes: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Battery Power</li>
  <li>AC Power</li>
</ul>

<p>So grabbing that string gives us a simple way to know where our energy is coming from. I didn’t want to just <em>say</em> “Battery” or “AC”, though, so I’m using the emoji for battery and lightning respectively<sup id="fnref:plug"><a href="#fn:plug" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>On the second line there are three things we want to know: how charged the battery is, if it’s charging or discharging (or charged) and how long until it’s done doing what it’s doing. I decided to represent the charge level of the battery using five stars, because that fits nicely and a 5-star system makes sense to people. I didn’t even need emoji for full or hollow stars, they’re part of UTF-8, so that was even easier. After a little thought I decided (for now) not to represent the charging/discharging/charged state specifically. I’m still capturing it, I’m just not displaying it.</p>

<p>So a few minutes of ruby hacking later and I have a script that gets me all the info I need and displays it using pretty pictures. Now all I need to do is get it into tmux. Fortunately that was also very simple. This line: </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Display Battery Info </span><a href="https://raw.github.com/PogiNate/dots/master/home/.tmux.conf">Link to file on Github </a></figcaption> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nb">set</span> -g status-right <span class="s2">&quot;#[fg=colour155]#(pmset -g batt | ~/bin/battinfo.rb) | #[fg=colour45]%d %b %R&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>runs the <code>pmset</code> command and my script and gives me a nice green row of stars and a cyan-ish date, like so:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/charged.png" title="Charged tmux status bar" /></p>

<p>And like so:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/battery.png" title="Battery power tmux status bar" /></p>

<p>It shows one star empty the moment the battery level falls below 100%, because of math, but I’m fine with that.</p>

<p>So: about an hour’s worth of work for something that will technically save me no time at all, ever. According to<a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/"> XKCD’s chart</a>, it wasn’t worth the time, but I’m still perfectly happy with it. I’m considering updating the script to be more tmux-specific, perhaps even coloring the output based on the charging state, but for now this is good and isn’t terribly distracting.</p>

<p>Anyway, the battinfo.rb script is below, my <code>.tmux.conf</code> file is on github with all <a href="https://github.com/PogiNate/dots">my other dot files</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve never been a fan of cities. New York and Los Angeles hold no fascination for me. Rome is historically interesting, but I wouldn’t ever want to actually <em>go</em> there. I’d rather spend some time in the Italian countryside somewhere, out of the way of the crowds and slowly learning Italian.</p>

<p>Or I could spend my time in suburban Utah. The hills don’t stay as green, and we have a lot of snow and cold and suchlike to deal with, but on the other hand I don’t have to learn Italian. </p>

<p>But cities spread, and they spread around those of us who moved here specifically to <em>avoid</em> them. It doesn’t seem fair. The biggest challenge facing us introverts is accepting the fact that we’re connected to all those other people all over the place; you know, the ones we’re being introverted from. Extroverts like us, because they like <em>everybody</em>, a fact we can’t quite make ourselves believe. But for them people are as necessary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as solitude is for us; they seek out people the way we seek out quiet places. </p>

<p>So cities spread, communities form. In our more rational moments we introverts can accept that community and civilization are important, we just don’t want them around <em>here</em>.</p>

<p>Then there are the even more conflicted introverts; the ones who need the city support system to provide them with quiet little coffee houses and public transportation and eclectic bookstores. Forever taunting themselves with the crowds of happy people that don’t include them, knowing (because all introverts are amazingly, painfully self-aware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) that the crowds <em>probably</em> aren’t judging them, that the only thing stopping the introvert from packing up his journal and latte and finding happiness in the company of other people is his own blasted self.</p>

<p>And there are those of us (like me) who enjoy time with people, but still need to make a quiet retreat into our own little world, where our thoughts are the only ones around and we can start to decompress, unwind, and come up with other metaphors for releasing stress after being stressed out in a fun (but tension causing) social setting. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="… which is part of why I&#8217;m a blogger instead of a city councilor. Or whatever it is more extroverted people do.">
People often talk about having an “introvert battery” or an “extrovert battery”, recharging by being with others or recharging by being alone. I think we probably all have both, but for some people one person a week charges their extrovert battery more than enough, and for others the introvert battery gets all the charge it needs when they spend a few hours asleep. I need a pretty solid dose of both social time and quiet time, but probably just a little more quiet time … which is part of why I’m a blogger instead of a city councilor. Or whatever it is more extroverted people do.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I discovered RSS I’ve had an aversion to reading news stories in someone else’s web page. With the passing of google reader now a fact of life, we’ve got to find other ways to satisfy the need to feed.</p>

<p>Fortunately Read it Later happened. I wasn’t there for the early days; indeed, I discovered this fabulous little tool after it changed its name to <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, but I still love it, and here’s why: It lets me manage my time better. </p>

I’m not going to bookmark it, bookmarks are too permanent and too ignored to be useful<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Usually I would just read the article right there, then try to rebuild the context I had been in. These days I press a little button, wait for the popup that says “Page saved!” and go back to my real research. Then, some time when I’m <a href="http://mike-garcia.com/?p=466">not doing anything specific</a> I can go back to that article and read it all. </p>

<p>This has a lot of nice side affects. My <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoros</a> are preserved, my focus is maintained, and the part of my brain that is endlessly curious is satisfied that it’s not being ignored.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="No offense, but I probably hate your web site.">
Another benefit is that <em>your</em> content is now styled <em>my</em> way. No offense, but I probably hate your web site. It probably has ads and  call outs to reasons why you’re cool and probably doesn’t look so hot on  my phone<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.  Pocket lets me restyle all of that, and thus I intereact with your core message far more than I would have if I had to put up with your design decisions. <a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> has an <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/the-future-is-unevenly-superdistributed" title="The Future is Unevenly Superdistributed">excellent article</a> on this topic, with the following insight that gave me pause:
</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…digital content continues to find novel new ways to wander away from its various points of origin. Tools that give users ever more control over formatting, timeshifting, and sharing will continue to proliferate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact is that I discovered this article in RSS and read it in Pocket was an interesting testament to the author’s thesis<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Although pinboard is changing that for me; an article on pinboard is forthcoming. Probably.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Don’t feel bad; my site is pretty ugly as well. So hit the pocket button on this page, and I promise not to be offended. <a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the joys of moving from a Windows machine at work to OSX is that I’m back to having access to the unix command line. The downside, of course, long commands that I <a href="http://xkcd.com/1168/">usually get wrong</a>. </p>

<p>Which is why I spent some time a few weeks ago creating <a href="http://natedickson.com/A.K.A./">A.K.A.</a> Simply put, A.K.A. is a simple way to manage all the aliases that you usually put into your shell of choice’s startup file without editing your dot files by hand or cluttering up your profile when you could be cluttering up a completely separate file. </p>

<p>Now all you have to do is add <code>source ~/.alias</code> and use this script to keep everything nice and organized.</p>

<p>Again, it’s a simple difference; If you know what aliases are you probably aren’t afraid of editing dot files, but <code>aka</code> removes the friction of pulling up your favorite editor, finding where all your aliases are, saving, etc. Everything is a single command issued right at the prompt, all the saving and moving around is handled for you. The result is that I have far <strong>more</strong> aliases, and far more <strong>useful</strong> aliases, because I can add them or change them without breaking my flow. If I realize that I hate typing <code>git status</code> I just run <code>aka -a gs "git status"</code> and now I’ve got a much shorter version of that command. The downside, of course, is that I get intensely frustrated using anyone else’s computer where <code>gs</code> doesn’t work. But I can cope with that.</p>

<p>My favorite (slightly under-documented) command is <code>aka -L</code>, which outputs a nicely formatted list of all your aliases and what they do when you run them. It’s a simple thing, but I like it.</p>

<p>In the event that you actually decide to use this feel free to put suggestions or feature requests or comments either on this page’s comment line or on the <a href="https://github.com/PogiNate/A.K.A.">github page</a>. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, my big concern in moving over to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> was the lack of MultiMarkdown compatibility. Specifically the lack of footnotes. I <em>think</em> in footnotes a lot of the time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So it was a definite problem to go to something limited to vanilla markdown. I did a few million hours of web searching to find a way to use MultiMarkdown as my renderer, but for some reason Jekyll is surprisingly resistant to the idea, so I gave up.</p>

<p>For a while. I’m not good at actually giving up. I had made my peace with using non-footnoted code for blogging and had moved on, until I noticed that <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a>, who documented his own move to Jekyll based blogging a few months ago, had footnotes aplenty on his blog<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. So I asked him how he was pulling that off.</p>

<p>Here’s his answer, in it’s entirety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just use Kramdown as my processor. Works way better than Maruku or Rdiscount for me.
-Brett</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it, folks. I made a single change to my <code>_config.yml</code> file:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>kramdown now </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="yaml"><span class="line"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">markdown</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">kramdown</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Bingo! Footnotes<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> now work and you get to jump around a lot more when you read my blog.</p>

<p>So that’s it really. If you’ve been looking for a way to use MultiMarkdown features in  your Octopress blogging the problem is really much simpler than you thought. Direct your thanks to Brett.</p>

<time datetime="2013-04-04T15:45:00-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 4<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ll admit it, I’ve had a sick love/hate relationship with <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a> for years. I first heard of it by way of <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, my beloved freeform creative writing app. And the Ulysses of then just was not a thing of beauty. The interface had a lot of holdovers from early- or pre-OSX days, and was pretty cluttered (which is quite a statement, given <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/gfx/ScrivShots/write_structure_revise.jpg">Scrivener’s interface</a>. I love Scrivener, but it’s clearly a <em>tool</em>…look, I’m off topic again.) and unfriendly. I could see some of the power that was inherent in the product, but it just wasn’t for me.</p>

<p>Well, A few days ago Ulysses III released a brand new version, and they <strong>nailed</strong> it. They took the bold step of abandoning everything they’d done before, threw out the interface entirely, and started over. They took a look at what the OSX world is doing now, in terms of interface, and did that. A very finder-like sidebar gives you access to all your text, organized based on where it lives. (iCloud, on your mac, or, if you have the <a href="http://daedalusapp.com/">Daedalus app</a> for iOS, in your Daedalus iCloud folder) Inside each folder you have your texts, (called “sheets”, as in “sheets of paper”) all of which are auto-saved at all times, so you don’t have to worry about hitting <code>⌘S</code> all the time. It’s a surprisingly slick and easy way to just sit down and <em>write</em> without worrying about filenames or sync options of any such things. You just start writing and worry about organization later, once you’ve got something out there. </p>

<h2 id="the-cons">The Cons</h2>
<p>It’s not all peaches and light, of course. The developers have pointed out that this is a 1.0 release, even if it <em>is</em> called Ulysses III. The app stores its files in <code>.ulysses</code> format, which isn’t interoperable with tools like Marked, which means its a little harder to get previews of your text post-Markdown-rendering. (It’s still quite possible, but not quite easy). It doesn’t natively handle <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a>, but it exports multimarkdown-compatible footnotes. I’m guessing that the <code>.ulysses</code> file format is a bundle that wraps up all the images and keywords and notes and whatnot, but it does make interoperability with other apps a little harder. </p>

<p>But this is a minor gripe, and isn’t a flaw so much as a design decision that was clearly made with forethought. They decided that Ulysses was written as a creation app. You can share later, but create your text <em>first</em>. </p>

<p>All in all, I’m deeply impressed with the level of polish and attention that went into the latest version, and I’d recommend you pick it up.</p>
