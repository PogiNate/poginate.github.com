    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was going through some old scraps of things I’ve written and found this brainstorming list of possible titles for my  <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">then-upcoming book on vim.</a> before I settled on the current title. I kind of like some of these, but overall I think I went for the best one. </p>

<h2 id="vim-book-titles">Vim Book Titles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Vim in One (Long) Day</li>
  <li>Long Day’s Journey into Vim</li>
  <li>Gradual Vim</li>
  <li>Vim for Smart People Who Could Use a Little Help</li>
  <li>Vim for the Wise</li>
  <li>Growing into Vim</li>
  <li>Reluctant Vim</li>
  <li>Painless Vim</li>
  <li>The Sane Person’s Guide to Vim</li>
  <li>Vim for the Sane</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I really liked <em>Long Day’s Journey into Vim</em>, but that cover would have been <em>hideous</em> and it didn’t really have the “friendly and breezy” vibe I was going for. Ditto <em>Reluctant Vim</em>. </p>
