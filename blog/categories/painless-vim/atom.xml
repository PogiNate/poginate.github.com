    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was going through some old scraps of things I’ve written and found this brainstorming list of possible titles for my  <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">then-upcoming book on vim.</a> before I settled on the current title. I kind of like some of these, but overall I think I went for the best one. </p>

<h2 id="vim-book-titles">Vim Book Titles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Vim in One (Long) Day</li>
  <li>Long Day’s Journey into Vim</li>
  <li>Gradual Vim</li>
  <li>Vim for Smart People Who Could Use a Little Help</li>
  <li>Vim for the Wise</li>
  <li>Growing into Vim</li>
  <li>Reluctant Vim</li>
  <li>Painless Vim</li>
  <li>The Sane Person’s Guide to Vim</li>
  <li>Vim for the Sane</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I really liked <em>Long Day’s Journey into Vim</em>, but that cover would have been <em>hideous</em> and it didn’t really have the “friendly and breezy” vibe I was going for. Ditto <em>Reluctant Vim</em>. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 1998 I served an <a href="http://mormon.org/values/missionary-work">LDS Mission</a> to the Philippines. Those of you who are familiar with how LDS missionaries operate know the drill: you spend ten weeks learning the language in a classroom setting and then you get sent out with a more experienced missionary to try it on your own. And anyone who has ever tried to speak a language they’ve only heard in a classroom setting knows what comes next: you spend a lot of time staring at people who speak a language you thought you were pretty good at, and you have no idea what they’re saying. </p>

<p>So I set myself some goals. I wanted to laugh at a Tagalog joke, because I actually understood it. I wanted to get my accent to be less terrible<sup id="fnref:accent"><a href="#fn:accent" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I wanted to actually think in Tagalog. These were little stepping stones I set for myself, goals I was trying to reach to show that I was actually gaining some actual fluency in the language. </p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>One of those difficult things has been learning vim. While I’ve been teaching myself to use it<sup id="fnref:painlessplug"><a href="#fn:painlessplug" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I’ve had a lot of moments where it just seemed too hard, too useless, and I had to set myself some goals. They were simpler goals, things like “don’t lose half a file and have to restore it from my git backups again today”, and then more useful goals, like “actually use the search and replace engine,” followed shortly by “actually use vim’s regex engine without the <code>very magic</code> flag”. Litte steps to show that I was making progress. </p>

<p>And one day, just a little while ago, I had a simple task ahead of me: remove the last three arguments from a function declaration. Without really thinking about it I got my cursor inside the parentheses and since my cursor was just before the closing paren I typed</p>

<pre><code>d3F,
</code></pre>

<p>And that was it. In English<sup id="fnref:kinda"><a href="#fn:kinda" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> it’s “delete back through the third comma before the cursor”. But that’s not the point. The point is that I just <em>did</em> it, without looking at a cheat sheet, without using help, without standing there for two minutes trying to figure out how to do what I knew I wanted to do. It was the “Kaya kong ito” moment all over again. I know I’ve still got a lot of vim to learn, but it’s clear that something is happening, and I’m learning something.</p>

    <li id="fn:accent">
      <p>According a couple of people who knew me early in my mission I was attempting to speak Tagalog with a British accent. Given the fact that I grew up in Boise, Idaho I can only imagine how terrible that sounded.<a href="#fnref:accent" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:sorta">
      <p>More or less. It’s not grammatically perfect, but it’s close enough that people would have understood what I meant.<a href="#fnref:sorta" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:kinda">
      <p>More or less. I’m sure there’s a better way to do this, and probably a better way to explain it, but it’s close enough that vim understood what I meant.<a href="#fnref:kinda" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a saying about marriage that you should find a spouse with your eyes wide open and stay with a spouse with your eyes half shut.<sup id="fnref:source"><a href="#fn:source" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve found this to be helpful advice about more than just marriage; when I buy a new computer I spend months reading reviews and write ups on the all the components involved and scouring the world for the best prices. Once I buy my components I all but block those sites on my browser; I don’t <em>want</em> to know that a brand new video card came out the same day my suddenly obsolete one arrives at my door. I just want to be happy with what I bought.</p>

<p>And, in an odd way it’s turning out to be true about writing <em><a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>. There are two books and a few websites that I used quite a bit while I was starting to learn vim, they are somehow on my “okay” list. But any site or book I haven’t read yet is now <em>the enemy</em>, because I’m afraid they’re all better than the book I’m writing and I’ll have to die now. There are (at least) <a href="https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro">two</a> <a href="https://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway">other</a> vim books already on Leanpub.com; I can’t look at them too directly lest I discover the only thing my book has that the don’t is a whimsical cover. </p>

<p>And, of course, what does it matter? If other books are better that’s fine; I can hope that there are some people out there who will get what they need out of my little book. So I’m keeping my head in the sand a little bit. Some day I’ll be done writing <em>Painless Vim</em> and I’ll be able to read other people’s vim books.</p>

<p>There’s no real point here; just a little note about how my mind seems to work when I’m mid-book like this.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Free Books!]]></title>
    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/07/11/free-books/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I recently put a coupon up on <a href="https://twitter.com/poginate">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://alpha.app.net/poginate">App.net</a> offering ten people the opportunity to get a free copy of my book <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>, which is still very much in <strong>alpha</strong>. But I figured attracting a few extra readers couldn’t do anything but help. </p>

<p>And in next to no time all ten free copies were gone, which is awesome. I’m not so much about the money on this one, I’m just enjoying writing it and really want to see it published and hopefully help a few people. </p>

<p>Anyway, it occurred to me that I hadn’t offered free copies to any of my faithful blog followers! So, here’s the deal: here’s another coupon code, also good for the first 10, nah, let’s say 20 people, but the condition is that I <em>really</em> would like any feedback you have about the book, even in this early state. Okay, ready? Here’s the skinny:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">https://leanpub.com/painless_vim</a></li>
  <li>buy the book using the coupon code <strong>Blog20</strong>. <sup id="fnref:paymor"><a href="#fn:paymor" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Give me some awesome and useful feedback on the book either through the Leanpub site, as a comment on this site. Or ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/poginate">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://alpha.app.net/poginate">App.net</a> with the hashtag #PainlessVim. However you get the feedback to me I will definitely take it into consideration and use it to improve the book.</li>
</ol>

      <p>And if you <em>want</em> to pay more than nothing I won’t stop you! Seriously! I’d be fine with it!<a href="#fnref:paymor" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
