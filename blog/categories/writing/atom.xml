This is a super-short post to show off what I’m going to be working on for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> this year. </p>

<p>I know that <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/">Painless Vim</a></em> isn’t finished yet, although it’s very close, and basically all I’m doing is a little bit of cleanup and formatting. If you’ve been waiting with baited breath for <em>Painless Vim</em> to be finished fear not! I will still be working on the Little Vim Book that Could during the month of November. In fact, my goal is to have it completely finished. By December 1st, even while I’m “winning” NaNoWriMo for the sixth straight year. </p>

<p>In previous years I’ve been doing graduate level classes, having babies<sup id="fnref:babies"><a href="#fn:babies" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and changing jobs during NaNoWriMo, and I’ve always found time to make it work. What’s more, the impetus it gives me tends to help me get more done in the rest of my life as well. The saying about giving work to busy people still holds true. If I turn myself into a busy person I tend to be more capable overall. Until I freak out and melt down, of course. So I guess there’s still something to be said for balance. </p>

<h2 id="more-about-pacifica">More About Pacifica</h2>

<p>Which is all very nice, but you may possibly be interested in the book cover I’m showing off here. You’ve got questions, no doubt. Questions like “What’s it about?” “Who designed your cover?” “Would you be willing to let me redesign your cover, because it’s pretty bad?” </p>

<p>The answers are “I’ll tell you in a minute”, “I did in about two hours using Pixelmator”, and “Yes” in that order. I like playing with Pixelmator, but I’m not super great with it, and if there’s a graphic designer out there who wants to take a second pass at this I’d be happy to let you. </p>

<p>The book is my first foray into cyberpunk. It’s a near-future look at what’s its like to be on the losing side of a war for independence, and how to keep your pride even when you’ve got nothing left to be proud of. </p>

<p>If I remember (and have time) I’ll probably post excerpts through the month. Wether or not I actually develop <em>Pacifica</em> after November remains to be seen, but if I’ve learned anything from five successful NaNo’s its that even writing an ultimately wasted story isn’t wasted effort. I’ve learned something from every book I’ve written.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll admit it, I’ve had a sick love/hate relationship with <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a> for years. I first heard of it by way of <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, my beloved freeform creative writing app. And the Ulysses of then just was not a thing of beauty. The interface had a lot of holdovers from early- or pre-OSX days, and was pretty cluttered (which is quite a statement, given <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/gfx/ScrivShots/write_structure_revise.jpg">Scrivener’s interface</a>. I love Scrivener, but it’s clearly a <em>tool</em>…look, I’m off topic again.) and unfriendly. I could see some of the power that was inherent in the product, but it just wasn’t for me.</p>

<p>Well, A few days ago Ulysses III released a brand new version, and they <strong>nailed</strong> it. They took the bold step of abandoning everything they’d done before, threw out the interface entirely, and started over. They took a look at what the OSX world is doing now, in terms of interface, and did that. A very finder-like sidebar gives you access to all your text, organized based on where it lives. (iCloud, on your mac, or, if you have the <a href="http://daedalusapp.com/">Daedalus app</a> for iOS, in your Daedalus iCloud folder) Inside each folder you have your texts, (called “sheets”, as in “sheets of paper”) all of which are auto-saved at all times, so you don’t have to worry about hitting <code>⌘S</code> all the time. It’s a surprisingly slick and easy way to just sit down and <em>write</em> without worrying about filenames or sync options of any such things. You just start writing and worry about organization later, once you’ve got something out there. </p>

<h2 id="the-cons">The Cons</h2>
<p>It’s not all peaches and light, of course. The developers have pointed out that this is a 1.0 release, even if it <em>is</em> called Ulysses III. The app stores its files in <code>.ulysses</code> format, which isn’t interoperable with tools like Marked, which means its a little harder to get previews of your text post-Markdown-rendering. (It’s still quite possible, but not quite easy). It doesn’t natively handle <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a>, but it exports multimarkdown-compatible footnotes. I’m guessing that the <code>.ulysses</code> file format is a bundle that wraps up all the images and keywords and notes and whatnot, but it does make interoperability with other apps a little harder. </p>

<p>But this is a minor gripe, and isn’t a flaw so much as a design decision that was clearly made with forethought. They decided that Ulysses was written as a creation app. You can share later, but create your text <em>first</em>. </p>

<p>All in all, I’m deeply impressed with the level of polish and attention that went into the latest version, and I’d recommend you pick it up.</p>
