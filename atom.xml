    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/09/fully-custom-keyboard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to all the amazing people who bought <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/"><em>Painless Vim</em></a> I‚Äôve got a little bit of spare cash to put into things that make my job easier. I‚Äôve had my eye on one such convenience for quite some time now: a customized mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/full_keyboard.png" title="My beautifully custom keyboard." /></p>

<p>For those of you who aren‚Äôt insane, mechanical keyboards are a <em>big deal</em> these days, amongst people who think too much about their working setup. If you want to know more about why mechanical is the way to go I suggest reading this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-the-best-mechanical-keyboard-and-why-you-511140347">excellent article on Lifehacker</a> that covers it nicely. </p>

<p><em>Anyway</em> when my recent royalty check came in from Leanpub I realized I was finally in the position to fulfill an old dream of mine: buy a fully customized, fully mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>A few years ago I found out about a company called <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD Keyboards</a>, and they are delightfully obsessed with making top of the line keyboards that fit <em>you</em>. Not you, the general purpose programmer, not ‚Äúyou‚Äù the one-size-fits-all gamer,  <strong>you</strong>, individually. If you want your keys to be in alternate rows of white and  yellow they can do that for you. If you want all your keys totally blank, the <code>HJKL</code> keys red and everything else black, that‚Äôs cool, they‚Äôre on it. However you want to do it, <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/gallery">they will do it</a>. You can design your dream keyboard on their website, choosing from several different key layouts, and the ability to specifically color every single key on the board. If the customization on the site isn‚Äôt specific enough you can send them a file with <em>exactly</em> how you want every key printed, and they will do it.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/extra_ctrl.png" title="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" alt="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" /></p>

<p>And it gets better. WASD is in the business of keyboards and keyboards only, and they listen to their customers. The <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-104-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html#ad-image-0">V2 models</a> have a series of DIP switches on the bottom that let you customize all the good stuff. Things like ‚ÄúMake <code>Caps Lock</code> into a third <code>Ctrl</code> button‚Äù for us vim fans.<sup id="fnref:notice"><a href="#fn:notice" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  Things like ‚Äúswap the <code>Alt</code> and <code>OS</code> keys‚Äù for us OSX fans. Things like ‚ÄúSwitch to Colemak or Dvorak‚Äù for people who take their typing seriously<sup id="fnref:notyet"><a href="#fn:notyet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. All these switches are handled on the keyboard itself, so you don‚Äôt have to mess around with system settings. </p>

<p>If you are crazy like me and care about the details, I got this keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches, which have a nice tactile bump halfway down, at the actuation point. If you understood that sentence, welcome to the club of people who should sleep more and study keyboards less. Pull up a chair. If you didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs nerd speak for saying ‚ÄúI can push the keys halfway down and they register, which is easier on your fingers, and when they register there‚Äôs a little bump you can feel letting you know the key registered.‚Äù</p>

<p>The build quality is quite high<sup id="fnref:CODEKeyboard"><a href="#fn:CODEKeyboard" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> from what I‚Äôve seen so far, with a nice weight to the keyboard, excellent motion on every single key, and sharp, laser-etched inscriptions on every keycap. </p>

<p>I guess if there is a point to this post it‚Äôs twofold: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Thank you, All of you, who have supported me in my writing.</li>
  <li>If you‚Äôre looking at getting a mechanical keyboard you should seriously consider WASD Keyboards. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. </li>
</ol>

<p>And now, back to work on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux/"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a>! üòÉ</p>

<hr />

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:notice">
      <p>You‚Äôll notice my keyboard has the <code>Ctrl</code> Symbol on the <code>Caps Lock</code> key. My keyboard is now 100% <code>Caps Lock</code> free.<a href="#fnref:notice" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/02/using-vim-and-scrivener-together/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-02T15:50:25-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/02/using-vim-and-scrivener-together</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve been working on <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_tmux">Painless Tmux</a> and trying to apply a lot of what I learned while writing <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a> to make the process easier and more streamlined. </p>

<p>And one of the problems that I‚Äôve been beating my head against is this:</p>

<p>Tables. </p>

<p>Tables in Markdown are a mess. Understandably so, because you‚Äôre trying to keep everything nicely lined up in plain text, which just doesn‚Äôt happen. Compound that with proportional fonts in Scrivener and you have something that nobody should ever have to look at. There‚Äôs a couple of problems here, of course. </p>

<p>The first is that it‚Äôs easy for bugs to hide in messy code<sup id="fnref:orText"><a href="#fn:orText" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I‚Äôve had to run my manuscript files through Leanpub‚Äôs markdown generator multiple times before I got my tables right. </p>

<p>So: step one: after putting all the data in a table let‚Äôs get the table all lined up and looking nice. This is where vim steps in. Specifically, vim with the <a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a> plugin. </p>

<p>Using Tabular I can turn a table that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |  
|  ------ | ------ |  
| some text | A second bit o' text |   
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text	| 
</code></pre>

<p>into this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1                                        | Heading 2            |
| ------                                           | ------               |
| some text                                        | A second bit o' text |
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text           |
</code></pre>

<p>all by typing <code>:Tab /|</code> in vim<sup id="fnref:learnMore"><a href="#fn:learnMore" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So far so good. But when I paste this back into Scrivener it looks terrible again, because Scrivener uses proportional fonts<sup id="fnref:myScriv"><a href="#fn:myScriv" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/kerned-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with proportional text" /></p>

<p>This was an even easier problem to solve, I just didn‚Äôt realize it it until today. Scrivener lets you use all kinds of rich text features while writing, all of which it ignores when exporting or compiling your text for output. This means, of course, that I can style my tables with a monospaced font and suddenly they line up the way they were supposed to all along. </p>

<p><img src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/monospaced-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with Monospaced text" /></p>

<p>But changing the fonts manually every time I make a table is a drag. Enter the ‚Äúpresets‚Äù feature that Scrivener uses. Its basically the Apple ‚ÄúStyles‚Äù menu, but enhanced and made more Scrivener-like. All I had to do was highlight the monospaced section, then in the menu go to <code>Format-&gt;Formatting-&gt;New Preset From Selection</code> and now I can make any of my text nicely monospaced with the click of a button. And while I was at it I re-styled the ‚ÄúBody‚Äù preset to be the the way I (currently) like it. </p>

<p>So there you have it: a couple of simple, common sense tips for making tables less of a nightmare in your Markdown manuscripts. Enjoy!</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/06/09/introducing-painless-tmux/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-09T08:58:01-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/06/09/introducing-painless-tmux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/pt_cover_web.png" title="Painless Tmux Cover" /></p>

<p>For about the last year I&rsquo;ve been working on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim"><em>Painless Vim</em></a>, and really enjoying it. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about writing, and of course I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about vim. But for the last little while it&rsquo;s been slowing down. I&rsquo;ve written all the text, and I&rsquo;ve been through a few rounds of revisions, both from changes made by editors and from changes suggested by readers. And now it&rsquo;s pretty much done. Sure, there are a few revisions left to make, but they&rsquo;re nothing compared to the work I&rsquo;ve been putting into it over the previous months. </p>

<p>So I decided to write <em>another</em> book. You see, I realized that, while I use vim for basically all my programming work, that&rsquo;s only half the story. Vim is great, but there&rsquo;s no real reason to use a terminal based text editor if that&rsquo;s <em>all</em> you&rsquo;re doing from the terminal. And for the past year or more, while I&rsquo;ve been learning and writing about vim, I&rsquo;ve also been using <strong>tmux</strong> to get more out of my terminal, and to compliment and augment vim&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m writing a book to compliment and augment <em>Painless Vim</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a> is brand new, and as I write this it&rsquo;s only 15 pages long. There&rsquo;s a lot of life ahead of it, and I&rsquo;m really excited about this one. For one thing, tmux is <em>so much easier</em> to use and to learn than vim. Especially if you&rsquo;re already using vim. </p>

<p>Together, vim and tmux let you do pretty much everything, all from the keyboard. so, I&rsquo;m also offering the <a href="https://leanpub.com/b/painless_productivity">two books as a bundle</a>, for significantly less than buying them separately. Basically if you buy the bundle you get <em>Painless Tmux</em> for a dollar. </p>

<p>When I started <em>Painless Vim</em> I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was getting myself into. I figured it would take a month, tops. Well, this time, I <em>do</em> know what I&rsquo;m getting myself into and I&rsquo;m excited to get into it. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/05/07/walking-home-with-chicago-avenue-moon/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-07T11:06:37-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/05/07/walking-home-with-chicago-avenue-moon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/Chicago-Avenue-Moon_web.png" title="Chicago Avenue Moon Icon" />
Heading out, leaving work. It‚Äôs about two miles home, an easy half-hour walk. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs all downhill. I decide to let Chicago Avenue Moon do its thing while I walk. Let‚Äôs hear some procedurally generated tunes. </p>

<p>The UI doesn‚Äôt tell me much; or rather, it <em>does</em>, but not in a way that I can understand. A string of numbers running down one side of the screen slowly starts filling in, going from all <code>0.00</code> to‚Ä¶other numbers. Probably based on my walking speed? A line swings across four circles, highlighting them‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs it. But it‚Äôs time to put the device away, time to walk. </p>

<p>The sound starts slowly‚Ä¶a quiet susurrous of static is all for a moment, then a gentle swell of strings, maybe?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/CAM-Screen.png" title="Screenshot from Chicago Avenue Moon" />
Slowly the sonic landscape fills in: quiet, layered sounds give way to rising waves of music. It‚Äôs like having an audio-only link to some other world. This isn‚Äôt music I‚Äôve heard a thousand times before, this is something new and unique, being created by my walk, and it opens my eyes. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen everything along this route hundreds of times, but I‚Äôm seeing it more clearly this time. Bright, living green grasses under a mottled gray cloudy sky. I‚Äôm more aware of colors than I‚Äôve been in a long time, I‚Äôm open to the feeling of the wind‚Ä¶and presently the rain.</p>

<p>I pull my umbrella out of my messenger bag and pop it open, imagining what I might look like from above. A drab, office-worker colored stalk, watered by the rain, suddenly bursts into a bright red and white flower fighting the wind. </p>

<p>The sounds of wind and rain fold themselves into the music from Chicago Avenue, and in my quiet and dreamlike state it‚Äôs easy to believe that whatever mathematical equations are controlling the sounds are also orchestrating the storm, for as soon as I turn a corner the rain slows, then stops. The music, too, changes gradually, adapting to my new position and heading. The whoosh and hiss of cars driving past in the rain‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all one.</p>

<p>At length I turn the corner onto my street, and one by one the layers of music fall away, leaving only a slow, stately tone, rolling in grand waves, and fading slightly, a fitting end to a walk in another world. </p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/chicago-avenue-moon.html"> <em>Chicago Avenue Moon</em> </a> is an oddity on the App Store. Created by <a href="http://junecloud.com">JuneCloud</a>, who are best known for their <a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/delivery-status-touch.html"> package tracking app </a>, it‚Äôs a pure work of art, and one that succeeds. According to the website, it was originally the vision of <a href="http://quieterrors.com/">Joshua Dumas</a>, a musician who wanted to </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶help re-enchant a person‚Äôs daily commute, trip to the laundromat, or evening jog. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A worthy goal. </p>

<p>The app really does create a soundscape that is throbbing with life, full of strange, alien combinations, and occasionally overlaid with bursts of static, as if you really were channeling this music from somewhere far away.</p>

<p>It may not be the perfect soundtrack for every single day, but if you want to include a little bit of mystery into your daily wanderings it‚Äôs definitely worth a try.</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/07/writing-with-the-alphasmart-neo/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-07T09:55:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/07/writing-with-the-alphasmart-neo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/NEO.jpg" width="400" height="400" title="The Alphasmart Neo in its natural habitat" />
A thing I once thought would never happen has happened twice: I have been paid for something I wrote by people who actually ponied up their own hard-earned cash to buy <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">a thing I wrote</a>. I can‚Äôt even tell you how awesome that is. If you are one of those people I thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>

<p>But that‚Äôs not what this article is about. This article is about what I did with the second royalty check I got from Leanpub a few days ago:</p>

<p>I bought an Alphasmart NEO. </p>

<p>I first became aware of the existence of these little wonders when I was reading Chris Baty‚Äôs<sup id="fnref:whoIsChris"><a href="#fn:whoIsChris" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> book ‚ÄúNo Plot? No Problem!‚Äù. Says he:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some NaNoWriMo participants swear by an affordable machine called an Alphasmart (www.alphasmart.com). This is a battery-powered, word-processing device that looks like a cross between a laptop and a children‚Äôs Speak &amp; Spell. The miniscule screen only displays four lines of text or so at a time, which can be helpful in warding off obsessive editing. The keyboard is large and comfortable, and you can work for up to twenty-six hours on a few AA batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Äì Baty, Chris (2010-07-01). No Plot? No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days (p. 74). Chronicle Books LLC. Kindle Edition. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes. This is a right thing. This is genius,‚Äù I muttered quietly to myself. Here was something that embodied the ideal of ‚Äúone thing well‚Äù. A concept that I‚Äôve always loved, all the more because I‚Äôm so terribly bad at sticking to one thing for any length of time. </p>

<p>When I first read this the NEO2 was still a current concern, priced around $200, which was out of my price range, or rather outside of the budget I could concieveably justify on a writing toy. So I shelved the idea of owning one for a while and went on with my life.</p>

<p>And wrote <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a>. And got paid for it, twice now. Not a lot, mind you<sup id="fnref:yet"><a href="#fn:yet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but actual cash money. Which means I have a little money to spend on writing toys. But when I went back to the Alphasmart website I discovered that the Neo‚Äôs time had come to a close.</p>

<p>The NEO is no longer being manufactured. The company has shut down that arm of their business, and all that‚Äôs left is second-hand models that schools are getting rid of, as near as I can tell. But that‚Äôs a blessing for someone like me, because the price on a second-hand model on eBay is usually in the $40-$60 range. After a few hours of looking at all the different models that Alphasmart had ever made, comparing them and learning far more about them than I had previously thought possible I found one at the right price and a deal was struck. </p>

<h2 id="about-the-neo">About the NEO</h2>

<p>The NEO is a device that was designed to fulfill a very specific role: it is for <em>writing</em>. It is not for web surfing, it doesn‚Äôt have a browser or even a network interface. It‚Äôs not for games, it‚Äôs got a very simple display that can show you around six lines of text at a time. It‚Äôs not for reading email. It is only for <em>writing</em>. </p>

<p>Being designed for the classroom has other advantages. Alphasmart products are legendarily rugged, built to withstand grade school students long enough to justify the school board‚Äôs expenditure on them. They are an instant-on device, because there‚Äôs no real OS to load up. Turn it on, write. They are the most energy conscious devices ever: Several owners claim they will run for <em>seven hundred hours</em> on a fresh set of 3 AA batteries. So far I‚Äôve used my device for about 20 hours and I‚Äôm at around 98% battery, so that sounds surprisingly accurate. </p>

<p>Granted, the NEO is not a machine with great specs. For starters, it has 512K of RAM, which is charming. My Macbook Pro has roughly 33,000 times that much. But that 512K is enough to hold about 200 pages of text, split out over 8 files. When all you‚Äôre doing is writing you don‚Äôt need a lot of storage space. Text is small. </p>

<p>Equally charming is the NEO-computer interface: plug the NEO in via USB and the computer will recognize it as a keyboard. So you open Word or Scrivener or your favorite text program on your computer, put the cursor where you want the text and press ‚Äúsend‚Äù on the NEO. Suddenly the computer thinks the NEO is a keyboard where someone is typing at around 200 words per minute. </p>

<p>And that is the <em>whole point</em> of the device. It‚Äôs focused, so it can do it‚Äôs ‚Äúone thing‚Äù well. It‚Äôs rugged, so it can go camping. It‚Äôs inexpensive, so if it turns out that taking it camping was a bad idea you can replace it without too much heartache. And did I mention that it‚Äôs a very <em>focused</em> device? When you are writing on a NEO you can‚Äôt be sneaking peeks at your email, or twitter or anything else. All you can do is write. It‚Äôs the perfect middle step between a paper notebook and a MacBook.</p>

<p>It also imparts a strange and wonderful sense of detachment from the writing grind. Everything you write disappears off the top of the screen in a matter of moments, leaving you with just your most recent thought and maybe the conclusion of the one before it. More than once I have written for an hour or less, and felt like I got a little bit done, plugged the NEO into my computer and watched as thousands of words pour out across the page. Turns out it‚Äôs easier to be productive when you‚Äôre not worrying about your productivity. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/03/why-oyster-books-isnt-for-me/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-03T09:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/03/why-oyster-books-isnt-for-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>‚Ä¶yet. </p>

<p>Last Saturday I opened an account. The next day I closed it.</p>

<p>On the surface <a href="https://www.oysterbooks.com/">Oyster Books</a> looks like a great thing: pay $10 every month and get access to a growing library of books. This, you would think, is basically playing right to my wheelhouse. I love books, I love reading, and I love eBooks on my mobile devices. </p>

<p>But it‚Äôs not for me. Why is that?</p>

<p>I mean, $9.95 isn‚Äôt bad; it‚Äôs kinda-sorta the same price as Netflix, and I read far more than I watch in a given month. I could easily read four or five books every month and it would probably be a good thing, right?</p>

<p>Except‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Except what <em>kind</em> of books are on the service? I have a hard enough time finding books I consider ‚Äúworth reading‚Äù on iBooks or Kindle. Anything that is older than the digital age and not √ºber mainstream tends to get forgotten. Anything that has slipped into the public domain is spammed out on the store, thousands of copies, most of them terrible OCR transfers that were never read or reviewed before being shoved onto the store to make a few bucks. </p>

<p>And from what I‚Äôve seen Oyster hasn‚Äôt really drawn a different crowd. They have a number of recent best sellers, but a much shallower back bench than the other services, once you remove the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenburg</a> rips that everyone has. Oyster has a single Bill Bryson book, the other services have most of his catalog. I could keep going, but the odds are my numbers will all be wrong in a day or two. The <em>point</em> is that I spent a few hours searching Oyster‚Äôs catalog for things I really <em>wanted</em> to read and came up with a single book.</p>

<p>But ‚Äúworth reading‚Äù can be a dangerous phrase, and it‚Äôs one that doesn‚Äôt really sound like <em>me</em> to me. I have spent my life reading just about everything I come across. I‚Äôm an author myself, and I should therefore want to stoke the fires of my own literary career by pulling in the best of everyone else‚Äôs, right?</p>

<p>Well, yeah. But my time is limited. I work eight hours a day and spend six hours trying to build and maintain a relationship with my wife and kiddos. I squeeze in exercise, games and writing around the edges of this by sleeping between five and seven hours a night. So if I‚Äôm going to read a book it needs to be worth the precious minutes I give it. And here‚Äôs where a lesson I learned years ago comes back into play.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager I got hired by Bookstar, a small bookstore that was a subsidiary of Barnes and Noble. Shortly after I started at Bookstar we moved into a full-fledged Barnes and Noble superstore. It was a flagship store for the region, and was bigger than any two libraries I had ever visited in my young life. During the early days I would walk through the store in sheer wonder, feeling the immensity of the world‚Äôs wisdom, collected around me. I was in heaven. I was surrounded by all that was best and brightest in the world of words.</p>

<p>Except‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt. The world‚Äôs greatest books <em>were</em> in there; we had the entire Loeb Classical Library, both Greek and Latin; the works of Proust and cummings Chesterton and Wodehouse and Feynman and Hawking and Picasso and Miles Davis (in our music department, of course) and the upcoming geniuses as well. But they were thin on the ground compared to the romance novels, serial mysteries, spin-off sci-fi, brainless self-help books<sup id="fnref:disclaimer"><a href="#fn:disclaimer" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>‚Ä¶all the books that look very impressive until you realize that they weren‚Äôt written to increase the sum total of human knowledge, they were written to increase the publisher‚Äôs bottom line. For every masterpiece that was turned out because the author had a story that <em>must be told</em> there were thirty books that were trying to capitalize on the latest blockbuster. </p>

<p>And I read them. As an employee I was allowed to check books out from the shelves with the understanding that if I bent it I bought it<sup id="fnref:noBend"><a href="#fn:noBend" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I picked things up joyfully from just about every shelf and read and read and read‚Ä¶and realized that a lot of what I read wasn‚Äôt making my life better. I wasn‚Äôt any happier, I wasn‚Äôt any smarter or any more connected to my fellow human beings. I was just‚Ä¶older. But reading is addictive; even if you‚Äôre not in love with the book you‚Äôre reading you can still enjoy the experience. So I kept just reading anything, working my way through series after series of 300-page fantasy titles that had all the intelligence of a sitcom, but slower, or through 1,100 page epics that were anything but.</p>

<p>Finally I told myself that my time was worth more, and I needed to read things that were ‚Äúworth reading‚Äù. I got myself a list of ‚Äúgreat books‚Äù and started into it. Some resonated with me, some didn‚Äôt. Some were amazing and some had aged poorly enough that I couldn‚Äôt really follow them and lost interest. I still picked up light fantasy titles now and again, but I was determined to change.</p>

<p>So now I generally only read things that I feel have a real point or enough artistry to be worth the time. I say generally, but it‚Äôs easy to relapse. I fully recognize that some of my favorite books in recent years are entirely devoid of anything resembling substance or style. And that‚Äôs where I get back around to why I probably shouldn‚Äôt sign (back) up for Oyster, at least not yet:</p>

<p>I would start reading crap again. </p>

<p>If I was paying ten bucks for a service I would make sure I was getting ‚Äúmy money‚Äôs worth‚Äù out of the service by ploughing through at least two or three books each month. And I would <em>love</em> it. But I don‚Äôt think it would be good for me. </p>

<p>Instead, I‚Äôll just set aside $10 a month for new books. Buying one every a month is about right, and gives me time to catch up on my huge library at home. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/01/13/trusting-voodoopad/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-13T11:15:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/01/13/trusting-voodoopad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/vp_icon.png" title="VoodooPad Icon" alt="The VoodooPad Icon" />
I‚Äôve <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">mentioned before</a> that I go through three phases as I get used to a new program: <em>Inquiry</em>, <em>Inquisition</em> and <em>Investment</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Inquiry</em> phase is the ‚Äúdoes it do what I want it to do, without being irritating?‚Äù phase. Basically this is like a caveman poking a thing with a sharp stick, hiding behind a rock to see if it tries to bite him, then biting <em>it</em> to see if it‚Äôs worth eating.</p>

  <p>If a program gets past that, then comes the <em>Inquisition</em>: ‚ÄúOh yeah, well can you handle <em>this</em>? What about <em>that</em>? And how do you like the <em>comfy chair</em>?‚Äù</p>

  <p>Anything that makes it past the Inquisition with any level of approval gets my <em>Investment</em>, the phase where I put the time into learning how to use the program to its fullest and really start using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve put VoodooPad through the wringer before. Searching through my email reveals that I have a version 2 license<sup id="fnref:password"><a href="#fn:password" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I liked the idea, the core of VoodooPad back then, but it never got past the Inquisition. I could see that it <em>wanted</em> to do things right, but we never <em>clicked</em>. </p>

<p>Still, when I got the email that VoodooPad had left its original home at Flying Meat I was kinda saddened. It may not have been my cup of tea, but it was still an amazing product and it‚Äôs cool in a way that is hard to put into words. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think Gus of Flying Meat made the right choice when he decided to <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2013/11/a_new_home_for_voodoopad.html">sell VoodooPad</a>. If he doesn‚Äôt feel he can maintain it any more nobody would know better than he would. </p>

<p>The new owners at <a href="https://plausible.coop/">Plausible Labs</a> have promised to make it better and take great care of it, because they love VoodooPad and want to see it grow. That‚Äôs great news. </p>

<p>But can I trust it?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs two questions there: Can I trust Plausible Labs to keep making VoodooPad better, and can I trust VoodooPad to be good enough to deserve my investment?</p>

<p>For the record I‚Äôve already purchased my license; so we‚Äôre not talking about <em>financial</em> investment. I‚Äôm talking about investing my time, which is far more valuable these days. (‚Äúoh, look at Mr. Moneybags!‚Äù Yeah, yeah, you know what I meant.)</p>

<p>So, second question first: Can I trust VoodooPad, the program, to be what I want it to be?</p>

<h2 id="trusting-the-program">Trusting the Program</h2>

<p>This is the bigger of the two questions. After all, if VoodooPad is good enough to use and invest in now it doesn‚Äôt need a lot of updates all the time. My beloved Scrivener gets (I would say) <em>Just enough</em> updates: Not every month, but every so often. And even if updates stopped tomorrow I would keep using it until it no longer worked on whatever Mac I was using in the far future. </p>

<p>So I‚Äôve started the process. I would say I‚Äôm near the end of the Inquisition phase right now. And what I‚Äôve found is hopeful. Coming to version 5 of VoodooPad from version 2 left me refreshingly free of preconceived notions about the program: I knew it was a ‚ÄúPersonal Wiki‚Äù and that‚Äôs about it. </p>

<p>Markdown support has entered the mix since last I checked the app, and even better, it seems to fully understand MultiMarkdown<sup id="fnref:mmd"><a href="#fn:mmd" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is a huge win. Simple Markdown like headings, strong, italic, etc. are all handled correctly and shown while you‚Äôre editing the text. </p>

<p>The other <em>sine qua non</em> for a personal wiki that I had is inter-page links that just <em>appear</em> without any additional markup/markdown/whatever. When I type the name of another page I want it to be clickable. VoodooPad does that with aplomb. </p>

<p>So, as a personal wiki it‚Äôs doing what I want it to do. <em>Check</em>. </p>

<p>And there‚Äôs a lot more that I haven‚Äôt fully explored yet<sup id="fnref:investment"><a href="#fn:investment" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, like in-app scripting in Python, JSTalk, Ruby, shell, etc. and other potentially useful things like tagging, collections, built-in todo list collection‚Ä¶it‚Äôs basically the kitchen sink. </p>

<p>But there‚Äôs one huge dark spot: the iOS version of the app. It‚Äôs definitely been lacking in love or attention for years now. It‚Äôs not iOS 7-compiled, and most of the UI looks more like iOS 4. It doesn‚Äôt seem to open my main document, and it has separate editing/reading modes, thus getting rid of the main good thing I see in the desktop version. But, again, Plausible promises that improvments are coming. Which leads us to the second point: Trusting the company.</p>

<h2 id="trusting-plausible-labs">Trusting Plausible Labs</h2>

<p>This is where I have a bigger problem. It‚Äôs not that I think they‚Äôre incompetent, or lazy, or bad developers or anything. Just as I believe Gus knew when to get out of VoodooPad, I also believe that he didn‚Äôt hand it over to someone who would mess it up. But it‚Äôs not their baby. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm not saying I think they‚Äôll let it languish, but they need to know that now is a very sensitive period for the product. They shouldn‚Äôt rush any bug fixes or new features just for the sake of putting out a new version, but semi-regular updates on the blog about how the work is coming, some notification that they <em>are</em> working on it would go a long way to build confidence.<sup id="fnref:clockwork"><a href="#fn:clockwork" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>That said, I‚Äôm going to <em>Invest</em>-with-a-capital-I in VoodooPad. And I great hopes of seeing Plausible Labs do great things with it. I just hope we don‚Äôt have to wait too long. </p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Fluency]]></title>
    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/30/fluency/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-30T08:12:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/30/fluency</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 1998 I served an <a href="http://mormon.org/values/missionary-work">LDS Mission</a> to the Philippines. Those of you who are familiar with how LDS missionaries operate know the drill: you spend ten weeks learning the language in a classroom setting and then you get sent out with a more experienced missionary to try it on your own. And anyone who has ever tried to speak a language they‚Äôve only heard in a classroom setting knows what comes next: you spend a lot of time staring at people who speak a language you thought you were pretty good at, and you have no idea what they‚Äôre saying. </p>

<p>So I set myself some goals. I wanted to laugh at a Tagalog joke, because I actually understood it. I wanted to get my accent to be less terrible<sup id="fnref:accent"><a href="#fn:accent" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I wanted to actually think in Tagalog. These were little stepping stones I set for myself, goals I was trying to reach to show that I was actually gaining some actual fluency in the language. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="&#8220;Kaya ko ito!&#8221;">
And then, one night a few months after I landed in Manila I had a thought, just three words that came to me as I was walking across the town square: ‚ÄúKaya ko ito!‚Äù That was it. In English<sup id="fnref:sorta"><a href="#fn:sorta" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI can do this‚Äù.  But that‚Äôs not the point. The point was that I had the thought <em>in Tagalog</em> instead of having it in English and translating it. I had a long way to go, but it was clear that something was happening, and I was learning something. Since then that thought has come back to me from time to time when I‚Äôm trying to do something difficult. I‚Äôll start in one something, bang my head against the wall for a while, and all of a sudden there will be a moment of clarity, a brief glimpse of the summit after the first day‚Äôs climb, and the words ‚ÄúKaya ko ito‚Äù will come back into my head. I can do this.
</span></p>

<p>One of those difficult things has been learning vim. While I‚Äôve been teaching myself to use it<sup id="fnref:painlessplug"><a href="#fn:painlessplug" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I‚Äôve had a lot of moments where it just seemed too hard, too useless, and I had to set myself some goals. They were simpler goals, things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lose half a file and have to restore it from my git backups again today‚Äù, and then more useful goals, like ‚Äúactually use the search and replace engine,‚Äù followed shortly by ‚Äúactually use vim‚Äôs regex engine without the <code>very magic</code> flag‚Äù. Litte steps to show that I was making progress. </p>

<p>And one day, just a little while ago, I had a simple task ahead of me: remove the last three arguments from a function declaration. Without really thinking about it I got my cursor inside the parentheses and since my cursor was just before the closing paren I typed</p>

<pre><code>d3F,
</code></pre>

<p>And that was it. In English<sup id="fnref:kinda"><a href="#fn:kinda" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> it‚Äôs ‚Äúdelete back through the third comma before the cursor‚Äù. But that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that I just <em>did</em> it, without looking at a cheat sheet, without using help, without standing there for two minutes trying to figure out how to do what I knew I wanted to do. It was the ‚ÄúKaya kong ito‚Äù moment all over again. I know I‚Äôve still got a lot of vim to learn, but it‚Äôs clear that something is happening, and I‚Äôm learning something.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:accent">

    <updated>2013-12-05T10:20:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/05/not-during-but-due-to-nanowrimo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year marks my sixth year participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, and I‚Äôve started wondering if there was really a <em>point</em> to writing a ‚Äúnovel‚Äù in a single month. Especially since I haven‚Äôt really developed any of them beyond the rough draft I wrote in November. </p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/images/nano_win.png" title="National Novel Writing Month Winner" alt="National Novel Writing Month Winner" /> So, I ‚Äúwon‚Äù again this year, writing a book that I have absolutely no desire to pursue further. Which has made me wonder if I‚Äôm doing it wrong or if I need to maybe just give up on NaNoWriMo because it‚Äôs not helping me grow as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù writer. But then I realized something.</p>

<p>I never would have written <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em> if I hadn‚Äôt been taking part of NaNoWriMo every year. <em>Painless Vim</em> isn‚Äôt a novel, it‚Äôs not a wild flight of fancy that I pounded out in a month.<sup id="fnref:supposed"><a href="#fn:supposed" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  But there are a lot of things I learned from NaNoWriMo that made it possible for me to write <em>Painless Vim</em>. Some of the most important are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Write every day. This is the first and only secret of writing, of course. </li>
  <li>Write your first draft like nobody is going to read it, because nobody <em>is</em> going to read it. You‚Äôll revise it into something better. </li>
  <li>Write for yourself. There are others out there who are in the same place as you, and they‚Äôll appreciate what you‚Äôve written. </li>
  <li>Use Scrivener. <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">I absolutely <em>love</em> Scrivener</a>, and six years of NaNo‚Äôing has made it as comfortable as a well-worn pair of blue jeans for me. If I get up the energy I‚Äôll write a post about how my Scrivener workflow looks one of these days. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs best author. But I wrote a book and put it out there where people can buy it, which is something that never would have happened if it hadn‚Äôt been for National Novel Writing Month. And that‚Äôs enough to keep me coming back year after year.</p>

<hr />

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:supposed">
      <p>It‚Äôs a tutorial book that was only <em>supposed</em> to take a month and has so far taken me about six.<a href="#fnref:supposed" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/01/excerpt-from-pacifica/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-01T07:59:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/01/excerpt-from-pacifica</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the best study of my main character, the one that I think most accurately captures who she thinks she is. </p>

<hr />

<p>The roadway sparkles and flows with light, a jeweled strand across the dark landscape. Cylee sat far up on a hill, the fresh, wild wind blowing her hair back. </p>

<p>She used to live in this place, this quiet, dark, outdoor world. Back before Pacifica, before the war‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The strings of lights eventually merge into the cities, connecting the nets of lights that represent civilization, mankind‚Äôs crowning jewels shining in the dark. And once you‚Äôre caught in that net it can feel like there‚Äôs nothing else, no other way to live. You can learn to depend on the Network, constant wireless streams of information flowing into and out of you at all times. You can learn to read the streets as you read the trees, feel the way the social wind is blowing just as you used to know how to read the fitful pre-dawn breezes. </p>

<p>And, in truth, Cylee was caught by that net. If she stayed out here for a few days or weeks her Spine would shut down and go from being an Augmentation to being thirty pounds of stiff dead metal. She‚Äôd be essentially blinded and deafened, her limbs left to their own strength. Even now she was half blind, her Spine out of range of the Network and therefore unable to give her the kind of information that made up the background noise of her daily life. Granted, she could still see every living, warm blooded thing that moved in the darkness, every rabbit, every bat, every bird was a blip on her augmented vision, their insane heart rates pounding like miniature thunder in her ears. </p>

<p>But she used to track them unaided. Used to be able to sense the movement of creatures that were string to remain hidden. She could feel the twitch in the grass that didn‚Äôt <em>quite</em> match the way the wind was moving. And she would raise her bow quietly, wait for the next movement‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶with a soft twang she would have breakfast.</p>

<p>Out of a sense of irony and frustration she considered raising her flechette thrower and pinning that rabbit to the ground, letting her Spine handle the fine details of getting her hand in the right position, but she stopped, realized she didn‚Äôt need the meat, and shouldn‚Äôt waste it. Pacifica had made her a perfect soldier, but it hadn‚Äôt entirely removed the true hunter she had been. </p>

    <updated>2013-11-11T15:09:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/11/11/writing-with-my-head-in-the-sand</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There‚Äôs a saying about marriage that you should find a spouse with your eyes wide open and stay with a spouse with your eyes half shut.<sup id="fnref:source"><a href="#fn:source" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I‚Äôve found this to be helpful advice about more than just marriage; when I buy a new computer I spend months reading reviews and write ups on the all the components involved and scouring the world for the best prices. Once I buy my components I all but block those sites on my browser; I don‚Äôt <em>want</em> to know that a brand new video card came out the same day my suddenly obsolete one arrives at my door. I just want to be happy with what I bought.</p>

<p>And, in an odd way it‚Äôs turning out to be true about writing <em><a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>. There are two books and a few websites that I used quite a bit while I was starting to learn vim, they are somehow on my ‚Äúokay‚Äù list. But any site or book I haven‚Äôt read yet is now <em>the enemy</em>, because I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre all better than the book I‚Äôm writing and I‚Äôll have to die now. There are (at least) <a href="https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro">two</a> <a href="https://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway">other</a> vim books already on Leanpub.com; I can‚Äôt look at them too directly lest I discover the only thing my book has that the don‚Äôt is a whimsical cover. </p>

<p>And, of course, what does it matter? If other books are better that‚Äôs fine; I can hope that there are some people out there who will get what they need out of my little book. So I‚Äôm keeping my head in the sand a little bit. Some day I‚Äôll be done writing <em>Painless Vim</em> and I‚Äôll be able to read other people‚Äôs vim books.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no real point here; just a little note about how my mind seems to work when I‚Äôm mid-book like this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/pacifica_cover.jpg" width="250" title="Pacifica Cover" />
This is a super-short post to show off what I&rsquo;m going to be working on for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> this year. </p>

<p>I know that <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/">Painless Vim</a></em> isn&rsquo;t finished yet, although it&rsquo;s very close, and basically all I&rsquo;m doing is a little bit of cleanup and formatting. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting with baited breath for <em>Painless Vim</em> to be finished fear not! I will still be working on the Little Vim Book that Could during the month of November. In fact, my goal is to have it completely finished. By December 1st, even while I&rsquo;m &ldquo;winning&rdquo; NaNoWriMo for the sixth straight year. </p>

<p>In previous years I&rsquo;ve been doing graduate level classes, having babies<sup id="fnref:babies"><a href="#fn:babies" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and changing jobs during NaNoWriMo, and I&rsquo;ve always found time to make it work. What&rsquo;s more, the impetus it gives me tends to help me get more done in the rest of my life as well. The saying about giving work to busy people still holds true. If I turn myself into a busy person I tend to be more capable overall. Until I freak out and melt down, of course. So I guess there&rsquo;s still something to be said for balance. </p>

<h2 id="more-about-pacifica">More About Pacifica</h2>

<p>Which is all very nice, but you may possibly be interested in the book cover I&rsquo;m showing off here. You&rsquo;ve got questions, no doubt. Questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who designed your cover?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you be willing to let me redesign your cover, because it&rsquo;s pretty bad?&rdquo; </p>

<p>The answers are &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute&rdquo;, &ldquo;I did in about two hours using Pixelmator&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in that order. I like playing with Pixelmator, but I&rsquo;m not super great with it, and if there&rsquo;s a graphic designer out there who wants to take a second pass at this I&rsquo;d be happy to let you. </p>

<p>The book is my first foray into cyberpunk. It&rsquo;s a near-future look at what&rsquo;s its like to be on the losing side of a war for independence, and how to keep your pride even when you&rsquo;ve got nothing left to be proud of. </p>

<p>If I remember (and have time) I&rsquo;ll probably post excerpts through the month. Wether or not I actually develop <em>Pacifica</em> after November remains to be seen, but if I&rsquo;ve learned anything from five successful NaNo&rsquo;s its that even writing an ultimately wasted story isn&rsquo;t wasted effort. I&rsquo;ve learned something from every book I&rsquo;ve written.</p>

    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/09/17/using-nvalt-as-a-personal-wiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/nvALT.png" title="nvALT icon" />
One of the best things about <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> is that it gives you a lot of tools you can use with little to no friction. You can use tags, or not, you can store your files in dropbox as individual markdown files, or you can keep them all in a single database<sup id="fnref:database"><a href="#fn:database" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s all up to you. It&rsquo;s very liberal about how you use its powers.</p>

<p>Which means I missed one.</p>

<p>Up until now I&rsquo;ve been using nvALT as my repository of code and notes on projects, useful tips and hints and things that I tend to forget. You know, all the stuff that makes nvALT great. The praises of nvALT have already been sung, and sung better than I will sing them here. But here&rsquo;s what I just discovered: the inter-note linking feature. </p>

<p><strong>OH. MAN.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, those of you who already knew about this can just go ahead and laugh at me. But for those of you who haven&rsquo;t discovered this yet, it&rsquo;s very very simple and powerful. Just wrap the name of another note in <code>[[double brackets]]</code> and you have a link to that note. What&rsquo;s more, once you open the double brackets you can start typing the name of a file and nvALT will autocomplete it for you.</p>

<p>With this addition, nvALT has supplanted VoodooPad, EverNote, and my <a href="https://github.com/PogiNate/SublimeWiki">own home-brew Sublime Text Wiki system</a>. Not only is it more flexible, but it also has one of the best built-in markdown previews ever. </p>

Just a quick post to happily note that <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com">Days of Wonder</a> has finally updated their <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/small-world-for-ipad/id364165557?mt=8">Small World app</a> on the iPad. Small World was the first game I bought on the original iPad, and it&rsquo;s been sadly neglected for a quite a while. </p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s back in business now! It&rsquo;s beautifully, fully retina, has new content (available through an in app purchase), and now lets you play with up to five people via pass &amp; play, or you can have the one on one experience that you&rsquo;re used to from the original version. I&rsquo;ve always loved Days Of Wonder&rsquo;s games, and they continue to do a great job bringing them to the iPad. Thanks guys!</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/09/03/the-case-for-board-games-on-tablets/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-03T08:45:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/09/03/the-case-for-board-games-on-tablets</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I love board games. So it‚Äôs only natural that our kids will love them as well. And that‚Äôs <em>awesome</em>. But since all of our kids are under nine years old playing games with them can be a bit of a headache, because they don‚Äôt really have a sense of how losing one tiny little piece can ruin a sixty dollar game, and pieces are really small and easily lost. </p>

<p>Enter the iPad. I bought the tablet version of SmallWorld back when I had a 1st Gen iPad, and while it‚Äôs fun, at the time my wife and I only used it to pass time when we were waiting for a table at a restauraunt or whatever. Since then I have also picked up Ticket to Ride and Forbidden Island, and my kids and I spent most of this weekend playing all three games over and over and <em>over</em> again, as kids are wont to do. </p>

<p>And it was a pretty amazing experience. I still love my ‚Äúreal‚Äù board games, for a number of reasons: the artwork is bigger, you get a tactile sense of what you‚Äôre doing, the experience is more immersive, and you can see the board from more than two feet away, etc. etc. </p>

<p>But when you‚Äôre playing with a passel of excitable kiddos there‚Äôs a lot to be said for keeping the iPad firmly in my hands as they all take their turns, get excited by the (usually quite minimal) resulting animations, and go dance around the room for a while. When the game is over I just close the cover and the game is packed up, no cleanup required. </p>

<p>A quick note about animations: If you‚Äôre doing a straight up port of your board game don‚Äôt try to make it a full-on video game. Take a look at <em>Ticket to Ride</em> by Days of Wonder and stick to that level: make your graphics and chrome beautiful, but let‚Äôs keep it a board game.</p>

<p>The other advantage is price. Since all I‚Äôm getting is a pile o‚Äô bytes I don‚Äôt have to pay for a bunch of die cut custom printed cardboard pieces, which usually translates into around a 75% savings or better. The companies usually have a lot of high-quality assets all ready for the games, since you can and should use the same art for the digital and analog versions, so the R&amp;D costs are apparently low enough to make it worth doing. </p>

<p>Of course, in my situation this generally means I‚Äôm buying a game 1.25 times instead of 2 times, but hey, it‚Äôs still a savings. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/07/30/leaving-google/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-30T08:40:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/07/30/leaving-google</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Edward Snowden basically only verified what we had all already feared: The government is getting information about all of us behind our backs. The problem is that all this time Google has been promising that they‚Äôre doing a nice, open, transparent operation, letting us all know what they‚Äôre being asked for and what they‚Äôre actually giving, and now‚Ä¶well, I have a hard time believing them. </p>

<p>But it‚Äôs more than that. The old wisdom about eggs and numbers of baskets used to store them rings very true these days. Regardless of government requests<sup id="fnref:no_hide"><a href="#fn:no_hide" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, regardless of anything else, I‚Äôve gradually become uncomfortable letting google moderate all aspects of my online life. </p>

<p>So I‚Äôm trying to move away from services that I‚Äôve been using for  years. And the sad fact is that the alternatives just <em>aren‚Äôt</em> as good as the Google offerings. There‚Äôs no getting around it. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using in my attempt at going Google-free:</p>

<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>

<p>Back to the fox. Firefox was once a shining star of the future of the web and now it‚Äôs kind of like Safari: At least it‚Äôs not Internet Explorer. But it has plugins like AdBlock Plus <sup id="fnref:block_comments"><a href="#fn:block_comments" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and <a href="http://www.abine.com/how-donottrackme-works/">Do Not Track Me</a>, both of which make it easier to keep anybody from following me around on the internet. Again, if they want to know where I go all day every day they can just <em>ask</em> me (or look at my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:PogiNate">Pinboard</a>), but I‚Äôd like them to have the decency to ask.</p>

<h2 id="duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</h2>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> is a great search engine for people who don‚Äôt want to be tracked. It stores exactly <em>nothing</em> about you, meaning your searches aren‚Äôt tailored or customized based on your past search history. They have a great summary of <a href="http://donttrack.us/">why this is a good thing</a> linked to their home page.</p>

<p>The downside is that, well, you‚Äôre not getting customized results, which means that sometimes you have to dig a few pages down to get the content you really want. But the results are quite good and getting better daily. </p>

<h2 id="gmail">Gmail‚Ä¶</h2>

<p>This is the one that‚Äôs going to be difficult. Gmail is the king of free email, bar none. To get anywhere close to the feature set that gmail provides is going to require paying for email, and if I‚Äôm going to do that I‚Äôd like to pay for really <em>really</em> secure email. So I‚Äôm still looking for a good replacement. </p>

<p>At first I was put off by the really small quotas most email providers give you. I mean, Gmail is up to 15GB free! A lot of them charge you for anything over 1GB! <strong>GASP!!</strong></p>

<p>But then I looked at my actual usage. I‚Äôve had my gmail account for around 7 years, and I‚Äôve used about .56GB. Yep. Half a gig.<sup id="fnref:inboxZero"><a href="#fn:inboxZero" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> So I‚Äôm probably okay on that front. Based on that I‚Äôm looking at a few options:</p>

<p>-<strong><a href="http://lavabit.com/index.html">Lavabit</a></strong> is an email provider who values security, security, security. For $8 a year you get 1GB of storage <sup id="fnref:upgrade"><a href="#fn:upgrade" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and <a href="http://lavabit.com/secure.html">totally encrypted email</a>. The price is good, and as I‚Äôve said, I think I can swing a single gigabyte. 
- <strong><a href="https://www.hushmail.com/services/hushmail/features/">Hushmail</a></strong> Gives you PGP signed email‚Ä¶if you are sending to people who know how to open PGP encrypted email. They charge $34.99/year for 1GB of storage, but if you want to use a desktop email client via POP/IMAP you will have to go up to $49.98/year for some reason. 
- <strong><a href="https://www.fastmail.fm/signup/personal.html">FastMail</a></strong> is owned by <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> and is somewhere between Lavabit and Hushmail: it‚Äôs $19.95/year for 1GB, no mention of encryption on the server, but fully secure communication between client and server, and no (known) agreement with the NSA. </p>

<h2 id="duckduckgo-xmpp">DuckDuckGo XMPP</h2>

<p>Apparently Google is ending support for the XMPP protocol for Gtalk, which makes it a much less useful chat system. Which is a shame, because a lot of my coworkers use it almost exclusively. </p>

<p>But DuckDuckGo is there for you in this arena as well. They provide <a href="https://dukgo.com/blog/xmpp-services-at-duckduckgo">an XMPP server </a>that is much less Stalker-ish than GTalk, and also isn‚Äôt being deprecated in favor of closed protocols.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Google has done a good job of making themselves incredibly useful, and they make some very good apps. In the end it‚Äôs a question of how much you‚Äôre willing to give them in exchange for those services. I‚Äôd still like to believe that Google hasn‚Äôt totally abandoned their ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be Evil‚Äù mantra, but it‚Äôs still a good idea to check out the competition.  </p>

    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/07/17/using-slicereader-to-be-a-better-writer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/Slicereader.jpg" title="&#34;The Slicereader Icon&#34;" alt="&#34;The Slicereader Icon&#34;" />
Working on <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a> has been an education for me, and not just about vim. I&rsquo;ve  been working on developing a writing/editing loop that is more sustainable than <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>&rsquo;s joyous abandon, so that I&rsquo;ll actually do some editing. While I enjoy working quickly and just getting things out there in front of people, there&rsquo;s a problem with that model: not only am I terrible typist, I also write some terrible first drafts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385480016/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0385480016&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpnatedicco-20">Anne Lamott</a> would say that&rsquo;s okay; and I agree with her. But the problem is that I&rsquo;m also <em>really bad</em> at revising. Part of my problem is that I&rsquo;m a very good speed reader, which really just means that I&rsquo;m good at skimming over what I consider to be fluff and finding what I consider to be the point of the text in front of me. Good for getting through things quickly, bad for finding mistakes in my own text. </p>

<p>So I needed a way to force myself to slow down and actually look at the words. Not surprisingly it was <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/06/30/mac-app-review-slicereader/">Brett Terpstra</a> that clued me into this simple little &ldquo;one thing well&rdquo; app. With <a href="http://mthr.me/slicereader/">Slicereader</a> I just paste whatever chapter I&rsquo;m working on into the app, and it converts all of my Markdown into nicely formatted text<sup id="fnref:mostly"><a href="#fn:mostly" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and only shows me one paragraph at a time. Meaning I have to actually <em>read</em> that paragraph all by itself. Meaning I have to view it as a single entity, without resting on what came before or after it. Meaning I end up editing <em>every</em> paragraph instantly and repeatedly, reloading the text and seeing how my new changes stand up. </p>

<p>Slicereader is almost disturbingly focused on what it sets out to do: there are no fancy options to twiddle, no settings, no font pickers. You can choose daytime or nighttime mode. But when I need some  help focusing on my editing, having all those choices taken from me is definitely a good thing.</p>

<p>And yes, I&rsquo;ve run this article through Slicereader as well. </p>

    <updated>2013-07-11T09:11:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/07/11/free-books</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I recently put a coupon up on <a href="https://twitter.com/poginate">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://alpha.app.net/poginate">App.net</a> offering ten people the opportunity to get a free copy of my book <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>, which is still very much in <strong>alpha</strong>. But I figured attracting a few extra readers couldn‚Äôt do anything but help. </p>

<p>And in next to no time all ten free copies were gone, which is awesome. I‚Äôm not so much about the money on this one, I‚Äôm just enjoying writing it and really want to see it published and hopefully help a few people. </p>

<p>Anyway, it occurred to me that I hadn‚Äôt offered free copies to any of my faithful blog followers! So, here‚Äôs the deal: here‚Äôs another coupon code, also good for the first 10, nah, let‚Äôs say 20 people, but the condition is that I <em>really</em> would like any feedback you have about the book, even in this early state. Okay, ready? Here‚Äôs the skinny:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">https://leanpub.com/painless_vim</a></li>
  <li>buy the book using the coupon code <strong>Blog20</strong>. <sup id="fnref:paymor"><a href="#fn:paymor" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Give me some awesome and useful feedback on the book either through the Leanpub site, as a comment on this site. Or ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/poginate">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://alpha.app.net/poginate">App.net</a> with the hashtag #PainlessVim. However you get the feedback to me I will definitely take it into consideration and use it to improve the book.</li>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/05/30/from-scrivener-to-leanpub-in-one-step/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-30T00:46:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/05/30/from-scrivener-to-leanpub-in-one-step</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôm working on <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em> in <a href="www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, because I love its organizational capabilities <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> ‚Ä¶or have I mentioned my love of Scrivener before? (yes)</p>

<p>The problem arises when I want to push my text to <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a>. Scrivener has two very good ways to get your text out of Scriv into the world: you can <em>export</em> each text as a file, or you can <em>compile</em> it into a single document ready to send off to a printer. They‚Äôve both got their pros and cons, but to really understand them we need a brief detour into how publishing on Leanpub works:</p>

<h3 id="brief-detour-into-how-publishing-on-leanpub-works">Brief Detour Into How Publishing on Leanpub Works</h3>

<p>to publish your text on Leanpub you put all your chapters or whatever into individual <code>.txt</code> files, which you put into a special Dropbox folder called something like <code>~/Dropbox/name_of_book/manuscript/</code>. then you include a file called <code>Book.txt</code> to tell Leanpub what order the text files should be in when the book is put together. You can also create a <code>Sample.txt</code> file that tells Leanpub which text files to put into a free sample that potential buyers can download, and  a <code>Preview.txt</code> file that lets you just render a specific part of the book to make sure the formatting looks the way you want it. Okay, that‚Äôs your brief tutorial on Leanpub.</p>

<p>So, back to getting text out of Scrivener into this folder.</p>

<p>The compile option seems like a great choice at first: it creates a single text file made up of all the text in your document, formatted however you like, and once you‚Äôve created your compile settings it‚Äôs a single click operation. </p>

<p>The problem is with the Sample and Preview options. Since your text is all in a single file you can‚Äôt pick and choose individual parts of the text to give away for free. You could have two separate compile settings, but that seems very labor intensive.</p>

<p>So, the ‚Äúexport‚Äù option is the way to go, right? Every text section in your Scrivener project is exported as a single text file, just like Leanpub wants, you can create <code>Sample.txt</code> and <code>Preview.txt</code> files and everything is good. </p>

<p>Well, one problem. Let‚Äôs say  you‚Äôve got your book laid out in Folders instead of as just a list of text files in Scrivener. When it exports your book it creates the full file structure:</p>

<pre><code>Painless Vim
| 
+- Part I
|	|
|	+- Chapter 1.txt
|	+- Chapter2.txt
+- Part II
	|
	+- Chapter 3.txt	 
</code></pre>

<p>And so forth. You get the picture. This is a problem because Leanpub doesn‚Äôt do subfolders; you need all the files to be in the root of the <code>manuscript/</code> directory. So, after doing an export from Scrivener I needed a way to flatten out the file system.</p>

<h3 id="enter-automator">Enter Automator</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs the fun part. I could have written a ruby script to go through the exported file and copy all the <code>.txt</code> files to the <code>manuscript</code> folder. But that would have taken <em>minutes</em>. Like, <em>dozens</em> of them. So I decided to once again let Automator have a crack at it.</p>

<p>And it was <strong>easy</strong>. Automator has gotten a lot more useful since last I played with it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, with things like variables and other things you‚Äôd expect from a real scripting environment. What‚Äôs more, I was able to set up my workflow as a ‚Äúfolder action‚Äù, watching the <code>~/Documents/Painless/</code> folder which I created specifically for this purpose. Now I just tell Scrivener to export into that directory and Automator takes it from there. </p>

<p>The Automator workflow I set up is dead simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save the name of whatever just appeared in <code>Painless</code> in a variable called <code>New Folder</code> <sup id="fnref:names"><a href="#fn:names" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> .</li>
  <li>Get everything in the new folder, recursively</li>
  <li>Filter that list by file extension (in this case, we only want .txt files)</li>
  <li>Copy all those text files to <code>~/Dropbox/painless_vim/manuscript/</code>, overwriting any existing files.</li>
  <li>Delete whatever is stored in <code>incoming</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>And there you have it. The last step is just to make the export from Scrivener one step shorter, because it doesn‚Äôt have to ask if you want to overwrite your last export.</p>

<p>There are a lot of advantages to this setup. I can now export a single text file or folder instead of the entire project, and just that file will get overwritten. For single file exports this is nearly instantaneous, opposed to the <em>three whole seconds</em> it takes to export my entire project.  I  can also have <em>all</em> my files, including my <code>Book.txt, Sample.txt</code> and <code>Preview.txt</code> managed in Scrivener, which I couldn‚Äôt do if I were doing the Compile option. </p>

<p>Over all I‚Äôm very pleased with this workflow. It‚Äôs taken one of the pain points out of writing <em>Painless Vim</em>. </p>

      <p>Okay, I know it seems odd that I‚Äôm writing a book called <em>Painless Vim</em> and here I am admitting that I‚Äôm using a completely different editor to write it. What‚Äôs the deal here? The deal is that it‚Äôs really easy to copy and paste text around between editors (especially using Hog Bay‚Äôs <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor">QuickCursor</a>, but that‚Äôs an entirely different footnote), and while I do most of the actual writing in vim, I keep the text files in Scrivener for reasons that will be expounded upon in a future blog post.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

I&rsquo;m excited to announce the availability of <em>Painless Vim</em>, my new (indeed, still in progress) book on the ever powerful vim editor! While the book is still in progress, you can pick up a copy at <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Leanpub</a> right now and make suggestions to help guide the development of this book. I&rsquo;m very impressed by the Leanpub system, allowing authors to write their books out in the open and get feedback along the way. </p>

<h2 id="why-another-vim-tutorial">Why Another Vim Tutorial?</h2>

<p>I started thinking about writing this book when I realized I <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">wasn&rsquo;t the only developer</a> who has tried to use vim and was put off by the vast majority of vim training available. Vim is really very developer friendly, but a lot of the teaching resources for vim are anything but. My goal is to take the best of what I have picked up in my journey to vim and present it in a way that helps other people get over the initial hurdle and into the good parts of the editor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing quite a bit about the development process of the book and the workflow involved. Watch this space!</p>
