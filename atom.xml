    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Naturally, the first thing I did after getting Octopress up, running, and actually <em>deployed</em> to a real live server was set up a writing workflow that will make it easy to post to this blog. And by &#8220;easy&#8221;, I of course mean &#8220;weird and convoluted, but in a way that makes sense to me&#8221;. What else would I mean?</p>

<p>The first ingredient in my workflow is <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>. If you haven&#8217;t played with it yet you&#8217;ll find that  it&#8217;s a fast and easy way to access your project from multiple angles. You&#8217;ll have one terminal window open and in that one window you can be editing a file, keeping an eye on <code>top</code> and running your build tasks all at once, while a second tab has your development server running in it. I discovered tmux using Brian Hogan&#8217;s <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">amazing book</a> and haven&#8217;t looked back.</p>

<p>The second part of the recipe here is <a href="https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a>, a nice little ruby app that lets you set up tmux layouts in <code>YAML</code> instead of writing the commands out as actual tmux commands, like so:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5212311.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>You can see I have <code>rake generate</code> and <code>top</code> running on a &#8220;background&#8221; tab, so I can preview the site, and <code>vim</code> running on the first tab with a couple of regular old <code>zsh</code> panes at the project root and at the <code>_posts</code> directory, so I can issue other commands to the system and use Marked.app to preview my posts, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Obviously I haven&#8217;t been using this particular setup for all that long yet, but it&#8217;s got a lot of promise. I&#8217;m pleased with how it&#8217;s turning out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So hey, I&#8217;m moving this blog to Octopress now. I don&#8217;t need it running on a big ol&#8217; WordPress install with all those updates and whatnot; I just want a simple blog that I can update without using any tools that <code>vim</code> and <code>git</code>.</p>

<p>More posts to come; also I&#8217;ll be archiving the entire old site somewhere safe and sound so that anyone who wants to see what I wrote in the past can do so. For now the WordPress site is still up and running <a href="http://old.natedickson.com/">here</a>.</p>
