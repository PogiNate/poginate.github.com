    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="assets/images/FAR_Logo.png" title="The Five A.M. Radio Logo" /></p>

<p>So, between a full time job, continuing work on <em>Painless Tmux</em> and home stuff I decided I don&rsquo;t have enough to do. And a good friend of mine decided the same thing. Together we took these decisions and turned them into a new podcast, which I&rsquo;m excited to share with you. This new podcast is called <em>Five A.M. Radio</em>. </p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-called-that">Why Is It Called That?</h2>

<p>Five A.M. Radio was born out of Michael Boyle and I talking and playing games at right around Five A.M. every morning. We&rsquo;ve been friends for years, and recently through Steam we&rsquo;ve noticed that we both get up a lot earlier than we need to if all we wanted to do was get to work on time. And we started talking about the sort of things we do in that early morning free time. Sometimes we play games, sometimes we work on projects (like writing books), sometimes we just watch movies or TV shows, but basically it&rsquo;s all just &ldquo;whatever is exciting enough or interesting enough to get us out of bed early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Five A.M. Radio is an eclectic mix. We have five episodes up already, and more in the pipeline. It&rsquo;s a weekly show, giving you a little half-hour dose of our commentary on such fascinating things as keyboards, Magic the Gathering, Kickstarter, and, like I said, pretty much anything that catches our attention. </p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll check it out. The website is <fiveamradio.com>, where you can listen to each episode, and it has links where you can subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcast manager. If you have any feedback you can hit us on twitter as @fiveamradio, or email us at `hello` at the domain of the show, listed above. I&#8217;d love to know if there are any shows you&#8217;d like us to do. </fiveamradio.com></p>

    <updated>2014-10-06T15:20:18-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/10/06/douglas-adams-and-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was brushing up on some JavaScript for work and came across a problem that has bugged me before: testing for <code>NaN</code><sup id="fnref:notANumber"><a href="#fn:notANumber" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I’ve never dug too deeply into this one, I’ve just known that if you try something like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">NaN</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">NaN</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class="line">   <span class="c1">//a is NaN, do something</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">   <span class="c1">//a is a number, do something else</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The code would always do something else. so I usually found a different way to solve the problem. </p>

<p>Today I actually dug into it and found that in JavaScript the value <code>NaN</code> has some odd properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s a number.</li>
  <li>It is the one value in JavaScript that can never equal itself. </li>
</ol>

<p>So that’s annoying, but actually lends itself to a very easy solution: if you want to test if a variable is <code>NaN</code> you can test it like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="c1">// a is NaN</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="c1">// a is a number</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>But people who are good at JavaScript already know this. This is not news. </p>

<p>What struck me about this is that Douglas Adams invented a word for this kind of value: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. 
Douglas Adams, *The Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (p. 345). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. *</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow this made me actually like JavaScript more. </p>

<hr />

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:notANumber">
      <p>If you don’t know, <code>NaN</code> is a special value meaning “Not a Number” and is used to check if the variable you’re working with actually has numerical data.<a href="#fnref:notANumber" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/09/15/psa-deleting-songs-of-innocence-will-cancel-christmas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/U2_Songs_of_Innocence_cover.jpg" title="Songs of Innocence Cover Image" /></p>

<p>News of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/apple-puts-up-support-page-to-get-u2-album-out-of-your-itunes/">backlash</a> against U2’s <em>Songs of Innocence</em> has reached the North Pole. Santa Claus today has released a statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a time when people enjoyed having an old guy sneak into their house and give them free stuff. As my good friends Paul [Hewson] and Tim [Cook] have seen, that time has passed. So I am warning anyone who decides to use the “<a href="http://itunes.com/soi-remove">remove <em>Songs of Innocence</em></a>” tool. I wanted to announce that I will also be removing your name from my list of annual visits. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="we-were-young-not-dumb">We Were Young, Not Dumb</h2>

<p>I like U2, although their last couple of albums have been a long downhill slide and it’s unlikely that I would have purchased this one. So in one sense, I’m okay with Apple buying the new album and giving it to me <em>gratis</em>. </p>

<p>And I suspect that for a lot of people the album itself isn’t the problem. As one of my friends put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…for me, it’s a weird boundary issue. Like, I’m fine with someone sending me a free CD in the mail, I’m less fine with a CD randomly appearing on my coffee table while I’m at work. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of us like reminders that our devices are only “ours” on the surface. We try not to acknowledge that Apple<sup id="fnref:android"><a href="#fn:android" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> reigns supreme on the device. We like the illusion of security and privacy, and anything that erodes that illusion creeps us out. </p>

<p>For others, of course, the album <em>is</em> the problem. I trust Apple to allow me to buy whatever music, books, movies, and apps I want without censorship or oversight<sup id="fnref:with"><a href="#fn:with" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I want them to keep my music library safe, and keep it <em>mine</em>. I don’t want them dictating what constitutes “good music” to me. I like U2, so I’m not bothered by this particular album. But if Apple had shoved a John Meyer or Beyoncé or (more plausibly) Dr. Dré album into my iTunes library I would have been incensed. </p>

<p>So, Bono Claus, if you’re reading this<sup id="fnref:nope"><a href="#fn:nope" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: next time you want to give us something for free please just <em>knock</em> instead of coming down the chimney. </p>

<hr />

<p>I really liked <em>Long Day’s Journey into Vim</em>, but that cover would have been <em>hideous</em> and it didn’t really have the “friendly and breezy” vibe I was going for. Ditto <em>Reluctant Vim</em>. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/08/14/returning-to-opera/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-14T10:05:41-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/08/14/returning-to-opera</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/opera_icon.png" title="The Opera Browser" /></p>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>. I love that they’ve kept the faith, kept making an actual for-profit browser for decades, long after the browser crown has gone to, well,  <em>everyone else</em> over and over. I love that their little team keeps after it, keeps trying, and keeps making the most innovative browsers on the market, and then <em>doesn’t</em> turn around and sue everyone else for copying their best features<sup id="fnref:bestFeatures"><a href="#fn:bestFeatures" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Back when IE 6 was still the reigning champion and Firefox was still called Firebird I actually paid for an Opera license, and I would do it again in a heartbeat if they went back to a paid browser model. </p>

<p>Over the years, however, I have used the other darlings of browser-land, like everyone else. Firefox was my browser of choice for years, followed in due course by Chrome, and recently another stint with the ‘Fox, when it became obvious that Chrome was basically just inviting the NSA and advertisers to look over your shoulder the entire time you’re on the internet. </p>

<p>And I’ve loved my time with Firefox. No, it’s not as fast as Chrome. It never will be. But it’s (finally) also not as memory hungry, and is actually a pretty good citizen. And Firebug is a developer’s dream, of course. All in all it’s a very solid browser, and I have no real complaints. </p>

<p>So why leave? What changed my mind? </p>

<h2 id="heading-for-the-coast">Heading for the Coast</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/coast_icon.png" title="The Opera Coast icon" /></p>

<p>There are a couple of things. The first one was <a href="http://operacoast.com">Opera Coast</a>, the world’s most interesting browser. Opera once again decided to take a look at what a browser UI should look like and decided that everything that had happened up to this point was wrong and started over. Coast operates under the assumption that either you are going to go to one of the four or five (or ten or twelve…it doesn’t judge) sites you always go to on your mobile device and shows you those. It says this right on the website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don’t care what you do with your time. We just want to make sure that if you decide to waste a little, you do it well. And, there’s no better browser to help you pass some free time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything about Opera Coast is tuned to this ideology. You’re probably going to waste a few minutes on one of your regular sites. That’s cool, here’s an icon for it. But what if you want to go to a <em>different</em> site? Well, if you are going somewhere new you are going to do a search, right? Okay, pull down to search. Watch the awesome search thingy figure out what you’re looking for and start pre-loading sites while you’re still typing. And if you’re feeling even less directed the search area will show you a list of good time wasting sites without searching at all, a feature I have used more than once. If you decide you like one of these new sites you have the option of adding a chip to the home screen, making it that much easier to come back to the next time you have a few moments to kill. </p>

<p>All the techy parts of the browser are gone. You don’t have an address bar. When you are on a page there is zero chrome around the page except a little shortcut back to the home screen. All the interactions are intuitive and fluid. Opera has made a browser that actually makes sense on a phone. </p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-desk">Back to the Desk</h2>

<p>So, having discovered Coast, I decided to see what desktop Opera looks like these days. It’s been a few years since I’ve tried it out, and it deserved another look. And a lot of the end-user consideration that has gone into Coast has gone into the desktop browser as well. Speed Dial, another Opera invention, has had a facelift and now is almost iPad-like in it’s use of tiles and folders. The new “Stash” feature lets you grab pages that you are visiting frequently for a while and keep them organized and visible. I can see this being helpful if you’re following a particular event and want to keep some sites handy while that event is going on, but once it’s over you can clear it out of your Stash and move on. This is definitely a psychological divide (it’s not that hard to delete bookmarks) but it works well. </p>

<p>And, again, if you’re just looking to kill some time you’ve got a Discover tab a la Coast. </p>

<p>Under the hood, Opera is using WebKit, the same engine that powers Chrome and Safari, so it’s sufficiently speedy and does all the typical browser stuff just fine. But the additional thoughtful touches in the UI have made it my current browser of choice. </p>

<hr />
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:bestFeatures">
      <p>Tabbed browsing, browser extensions, and a “speed dial” new tab screen are three highlights of Opera’s huge list of firsts. <a href="#fnref:bestFeatures" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/22/getting-back-into-podcasts-with-overcast/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-22T11:05:54-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/22/getting-back-into-podcasts-with-overcast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/Overcast_iphone.png" width="256" height="256" title="The Overcast App Icon" /></p>

<p>Back when I first got an iPod Touch I was <em>way</em> into podcasts. There were some weirdly terrible ones back then that <em>changed me</em>, man. But for a while my biggest reason for listening to podcasts was because I was commuting, and I needed something brain-stimulating while I was on the road. Ever since I moved closer to my worksite, however, I&rsquo;ve been doing far less with podcasts, and I realized that I actually miss it. So I decided to get back into it.</p>

<p>My mistake, unfortunately, was that I did some <em>research</em> before trying to get back into podcasts. I should have just downloaded the apple podcasts app and gone on from there. But that&rsquo;s not my style. Long story short, I didn&rsquo;t really listen to any podcasts <strong>at all</strong> for a few months while I decided which app I wanted to use. In my wanderings I discovered that Marco Arment of Instapaper fame was making a new podcasting app called <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>. This made me happy; I have loved Instapaper for years<sup id="fnref:untilPocket"><a href="#fn:untilPocket" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I respect his appreciation for minimal presentation around the content.</p>

<p>So I waited for Overcast to actually come out, again, putting off my dive back into the world o&rsquo; podcasts. I played with <a href="http://downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> for a while, but wasn&rsquo;t in love with it. </p>

<p>So, Overcast came out, and I wasted no time downloading it and getting back into the world of people talking at their computers. </p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m quite impressed<sup id="fnref:both"><a href="#fn:both" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Every part of Overcast shows signs of methodical, reasoned, intelligent design and execution. Which is quite a claim to make of a podcast player, I realize. I mean, all it has to do is mash an RSS reader with an audio player, right? </p>

<p>Well, sure, but you can do so much better. Podcast listeners have gotten used to a few things; they want their shows intelligently managed, downloaded (and removed) according to a schedule and without undue fussing. They want to be able to speed up speech-only podcasts, because you can listen much faster than people can speak. They want to find new and interesting things to listen to in-app. </p>

<p>And Overcast provides all of this, with aplomb. Everything is simple, easy to hand, and easy to use. But they added a few nice touches that I haven&rsquo;t seen elsewhere. My favorite is &ldquo;Smart Speed&rdquo;, which intelligently goes through and deletes pauses and breaks in the conversation, but in a very natural way. I have literally  no idea how it does it, and indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure it <em>was</em> doing it for the first few times I used it, because everything sounded so natural. Occasionally it will get stuck in the middle of someone&rsquo;s vocal gesturing and make them sound a bit robotic, but this is rare. For the most part it just saves me time without getting in the way. </p>

<p>And Overcast includes even more awesomeness in the form of the <a href="https://overcast.fm">overcast.fm</a> website. If you set up an account it will keep track of your status across devices, and also gives you a web player which also stays in sync. I created a <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid app</a> for Overcast on my macbook pro, which lets me listen transition from the iPhone to the desktop without missing a beat. </p>

<p>Finishing off the excellent features of Overcast is Marco himself. the <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM">@Overcast</a> twitter account is where he responds to user requests and questions, and he is <em>listening</em>, yo. Overcast is evolving based on user feedback, quickly and, again, intelligently. </p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Fully Custom Keyboard]]></title>
    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/09/fully-custom-keyboard/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-09T15:21:07-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/09/fully-custom-keyboard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to all the amazing people who bought <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/"><em>Painless Vim</em></a> I’ve got a little bit of spare cash to put into things that make my job easier. I’ve had my eye on one such convenience for quite some time now: a customized mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/full_keyboard.png" title="My beautifully custom keyboard." /></p>

<p>For those of you who aren’t insane, mechanical keyboards are a <em>big deal</em> these days, amongst people who think too much about their working setup. If you want to know more about why mechanical is the way to go I suggest reading this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-the-best-mechanical-keyboard-and-why-you-511140347">excellent article on Lifehacker</a> that covers it nicely. </p>

<p><em>Anyway</em> when my recent royalty check came in from Leanpub I realized I was finally in the position to fulfill an old dream of mine: buy a fully customized, fully mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>A few years ago I found out about a company called <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD Keyboards</a>, and they are delightfully obsessed with making top of the line keyboards that fit <em>you</em>. Not you, the general purpose programmer, not “you” the one-size-fits-all gamer,  <strong>you</strong>, individually. If you want your keys to be in alternate rows of white and  yellow they can do that for you. If you want all your keys totally blank, the <code>HJKL</code> keys red and everything else black, that’s cool, they’re on it. However you want to do it, <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/gallery">they will do it</a>. You can design your dream keyboard on their website, choosing from several different key layouts, and the ability to specifically color every single key on the board. If the customization on the site isn’t specific enough you can send them a file with <em>exactly</em> how you want every key printed, and they will do it.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/extra_ctrl.png" title="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" alt="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" /></p>

<p>And it gets better. WASD is in the business of keyboards and keyboards only, and they listen to their customers. The <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-104-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html#ad-image-0">V2 models</a> have a series of DIP switches on the bottom that let you customize all the good stuff. Things like “Make <code>Caps Lock</code> into a third <code>Ctrl</code> button” for us vim fans.<sup id="fnref:notice"><a href="#fn:notice" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  Things like “swap the <code>Alt</code> and <code>OS</code> keys” for us OSX fans. Things like “Switch to Colemak or Dvorak” for people who take their typing seriously<sup id="fnref:notyet"><a href="#fn:notyet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. All these switches are handled on the keyboard itself, so you don’t have to mess around with system settings. </p>

<p>If you are crazy like me and care about the details, I got this keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches, which have a nice tactile bump halfway down, at the actuation point. If you understood that sentence, welcome to the club of people who should sleep more and study keyboards less. Pull up a chair. If you didn’t, it’s nerd speak for saying “I can push the keys halfway down and they register, which is easier on your fingers, and when they register there’s a little bump you can feel letting you know the key registered.”</p>

<p>The build quality is quite high<sup id="fnref:CODEKeyboard"><a href="#fn:CODEKeyboard" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> from what I’ve seen so far, with a nice weight to the keyboard, excellent motion on every single key, and sharp, laser-etched inscriptions on every keycap. </p>

<p>I guess if there is a point to this post it’s twofold: </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/02/using-vim-and-scrivener-together/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-02T15:50:25-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/07/02/using-vim-and-scrivener-together</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been working on <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_tmux">Painless Tmux</a> and trying to apply a lot of what I learned while writing <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a> to make the process easier and more streamlined. </p>

<p>And one of the problems that I’ve been beating my head against is this:</p>

<p>Tables. </p>

<p>Tables in Markdown are a mess. Understandably so, because you’re trying to keep everything nicely lined up in plain text, which just doesn’t happen. Compound that with proportional fonts in Scrivener and you have something that nobody should ever have to look at. There’s a couple of problems here, of course. </p>

<p>The first is that it’s easy for bugs to hide in messy code<sup id="fnref:orText"><a href="#fn:orText" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I’ve had to run my manuscript files through Leanpub’s markdown generator multiple times before I got my tables right. </p>

<p>So: step one: after putting all the data in a table let’s get the table all lined up and looking nice. This is where vim steps in. Specifically, vim with the <a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a> plugin. </p>

<p>Using Tabular I can turn a table that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |  
|  ------ | ------ |  
| some text | A second bit o' text |   
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text	| 
</code></pre>

<p>into this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1                                        | Heading 2            |
| ------                                           | ------               |
| some text                                        | A second bit o' text |
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text           |
</code></pre>

<p>all by typing <code>:Tab /|</code> in vim<sup id="fnref:learnMore"><a href="#fn:learnMore" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So far so good. But when I paste this back into Scrivener it looks terrible again, because Scrivener uses proportional fonts<sup id="fnref:myScriv"><a href="#fn:myScriv" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/kerned-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with proportional text" /></p>

<p>This was an even easier problem to solve, I just didn’t realize it it until today. Scrivener lets you use all kinds of rich text features while writing, all of which it ignores when exporting or compiling your text for output. This means, of course, that I can style my tables with a monospaced font and suddenly they line up the way they were supposed to all along. </p>

<p><img src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/monospaced-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with Monospaced text" /></p>

<p>But changing the fonts manually every time I make a table is a drag. Enter the “presets” feature that Scrivener uses. Its basically the Apple “Styles” menu, but enhanced and made more Scrivener-like. All I had to do was highlight the monospaced section, then in the menu go to <code>Format-&gt;Formatting-&gt;New Preset From Selection</code> and now I can make any of my text nicely monospaced with the click of a button. And while I was at it I re-styled the “Body” preset to be the the way I (currently) like it. </p>

<p>So there you have it: a couple of simple, common sense tips for making tables less of a nightmare in your Markdown manuscripts. Enjoy!</p>

    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/06/09/introducing-painless-tmux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/pt_cover_web.png" title="Painless Tmux Cover" /></p>

<p>For about the last year I&rsquo;ve been working on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim"><em>Painless Vim</em></a>, and really enjoying it. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about writing, and of course I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about vim. But for the last little while it&rsquo;s been slowing down. I&rsquo;ve written all the text, and I&rsquo;ve been through a few rounds of revisions, both from changes made by editors and from changes suggested by readers. And now it&rsquo;s pretty much done. Sure, there are a few revisions left to make, but they&rsquo;re nothing compared to the work I&rsquo;ve been putting into it over the previous months. </p>

<p>So I decided to write <em>another</em> book. You see, I realized that, while I use vim for basically all my programming work, that&rsquo;s only half the story. Vim is great, but there&rsquo;s no real reason to use a terminal based text editor if that&rsquo;s <em>all</em> you&rsquo;re doing from the terminal. And for the past year or more, while I&rsquo;ve been learning and writing about vim, I&rsquo;ve also been using <strong>tmux</strong> to get more out of my terminal, and to compliment and augment vim&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m writing a book to compliment and augment <em>Painless Vim</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a> is brand new, and as I write this it&rsquo;s only 15 pages long. There&rsquo;s a lot of life ahead of it, and I&rsquo;m really excited about this one. For one thing, tmux is <em>so much easier</em> to use and to learn than vim. Especially if you&rsquo;re already using vim. </p>

<p>Together, vim and tmux let you do pretty much everything, all from the keyboard. so, I&rsquo;m also offering the <a href="https://leanpub.com/b/painless_productivity">two books as a bundle</a>, for significantly less than buying them separately. Basically if you buy the bundle you get <em>Painless Tmux</em> for a dollar. </p>

<p>When I started <em>Painless Vim</em> I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was getting myself into. I figured it would take a month, tops. Well, this time, I <em>do</em> know what I&rsquo;m getting myself into and I&rsquo;m excited to get into it. </p>

    <updated>2014-05-07T11:06:37-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/05/07/walking-home-with-chicago-avenue-moon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/Chicago-Avenue-Moon_web.png" title="Chicago Avenue Moon Icon" />
Heading out, leaving work. It’s about two miles home, an easy half-hour walk. What’s more, it’s all downhill. I decide to let Chicago Avenue Moon do its thing while I walk. Let’s hear some procedurally generated tunes. </p>

<p>The UI doesn’t tell me much; or rather, it <em>does</em>, but not in a way that I can understand. A string of numbers running down one side of the screen slowly starts filling in, going from all <code>0.00</code> to…other numbers. Probably based on my walking speed? A line swings across four circles, highlighting them…and that’s it. But it’s time to put the device away, time to walk. </p>

<p>The sound starts slowly…a quiet susurrous of static is all for a moment, then a gentle swell of strings, maybe?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/CAM-Screen.png" title="Screenshot from Chicago Avenue Moon" />
Slowly the sonic landscape fills in: quiet, layered sounds give way to rising waves of music. It’s like having an audio-only link to some other world. This isn’t music I’ve heard a thousand times before, this is something new and unique, being created by my walk, and it opens my eyes. </p>

<p>I’ve seen everything along this route hundreds of times, but I’m seeing it more clearly this time. Bright, living green grasses under a mottled gray cloudy sky. I’m more aware of colors than I’ve been in a long time, I’m open to the feeling of the wind…and presently the rain.</p>

<p>I pull my umbrella out of my messenger bag and pop it open, imagining what I might look like from above. A drab, office-worker colored stalk, watered by the rain, suddenly bursts into a bright red and white flower fighting the wind. </p>

<p>The sounds of wind and rain fold themselves into the music from Chicago Avenue, and in my quiet and dreamlike state it’s easy to believe that whatever mathematical equations are controlling the sounds are also orchestrating the storm, for as soon as I turn a corner the rain slows, then stops. The music, too, changes gradually, adapting to my new position and heading. The whoosh and hiss of cars driving past in the rain…it’s all one.</p>

<p>At length I turn the corner onto my street, and one by one the layers of music fall away, leaving only a slow, stately tone, rolling in grand waves, and fading slightly, a fitting end to a walk in another world. </p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/chicago-avenue-moon.html"> <em>Chicago Avenue Moon</em> </a> is an oddity on the App Store. Created by <a href="http://junecloud.com">JuneCloud</a>, who are best known for their <a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/delivery-status-touch.html"> package tracking app </a>, it’s a pure work of art, and one that succeeds. According to the website, it was originally the vision of <a href="http://quieterrors.com/">Joshua Dumas</a>, a musician who wanted to </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…help re-enchant a person’s daily commute, trip to the laundromat, or evening jog. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A worthy goal. </p>

<p>The app really does create a soundscape that is throbbing with life, full of strange, alien combinations, and occasionally overlaid with bursts of static, as if you really were channeling this music from somewhere far away.</p>

<p>It may not be the perfect soundtrack for every single day, but if you want to include a little bit of mystery into your daily wanderings it’s definitely worth a try.</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/07/writing-with-the-alphasmart-neo/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-07T09:55:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/07/writing-with-the-alphasmart-neo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/NEO.jpg" width="400" height="400" title="The Alphasmart Neo in its natural habitat" />
A thing I once thought would never happen has happened twice: I have been paid for something I wrote by people who actually ponied up their own hard-earned cash to buy <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">a thing I wrote</a>. I can’t even tell you how awesome that is. If you are one of those people I thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>

<p>But that’s not what this article is about. This article is about what I did with the second royalty check I got from Leanpub a few days ago:</p>

<p>I bought an Alphasmart NEO. </p>

<p>I first became aware of the existence of these little wonders when I was reading Chris Baty’s<sup id="fnref:whoIsChris"><a href="#fn:whoIsChris" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> book “No Plot? No Problem!”. Says he:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some NaNoWriMo participants swear by an affordable machine called an Alphasmart (www.alphasmart.com). This is a battery-powered, word-processing device that looks like a cross between a laptop and a children’s Speak &amp; Spell. The miniscule screen only displays four lines of text or so at a time, which can be helpful in warding off obsessive editing. The keyboard is large and comfortable, and you can work for up to twenty-six hours on a few AA batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Baty, Chris (2010-07-01). No Plot? No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days (p. 74). Chronicle Books LLC. Kindle Edition. </p>

<p>“Yes. This is a right thing. This is genius,” I muttered quietly to myself. Here was something that embodied the ideal of “one thing well”. A concept that I’ve always loved, all the more because I’m so terribly bad at sticking to one thing for any length of time. </p>

<p>When I first read this the NEO2 was still a current concern, priced around $200, which was out of my price range, or rather outside of the budget I could concieveably justify on a writing toy. So I shelved the idea of owning one for a while and went on with my life.</p>

<p>And wrote <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a>. And got paid for it, twice now. Not a lot, mind you<sup id="fnref:yet"><a href="#fn:yet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but actual cash money. Which means I have a little money to spend on writing toys. But when I went back to the Alphasmart website I discovered that the Neo’s time had come to a close.</p>

<p>The NEO is no longer being manufactured. The company has shut down that arm of their business, and all that’s left is second-hand models that schools are getting rid of, as near as I can tell. But that’s a blessing for someone like me, because the price on a second-hand model on eBay is usually in the $40-$60 range. After a few hours of looking at all the different models that Alphasmart had ever made, comparing them and learning far more about them than I had previously thought possible I found one at the right price and a deal was struck. </p>

<h2 id="about-the-neo">About the NEO</h2>

<p>The NEO is a device that was designed to fulfill a very specific role: it is for <em>writing</em>. It is not for web surfing, it doesn’t have a browser or even a network interface. It’s not for games, it’s got a very simple display that can show you around six lines of text at a time. It’s not for reading email. It is only for <em>writing</em>. </p>

<p>Being designed for the classroom has other advantages. Alphasmart products are legendarily rugged, built to withstand grade school students long enough to justify the school board’s expenditure on them. They are an instant-on device, because there’s no real OS to load up. Turn it on, write. They are the most energy conscious devices ever: Several owners claim they will run for <em>seven hundred hours</em> on a fresh set of 3 AA batteries. So far I’ve used my device for about 20 hours and I’m at around 98% battery, so that sounds surprisingly accurate. </p>

<p>Granted, the NEO is not a machine with great specs. For starters, it has 512K of RAM, which is charming. My Macbook Pro has roughly 33,000 times that much. But that 512K is enough to hold about 200 pages of text, split out over 8 files. When all you’re doing is writing you don’t need a lot of storage space. Text is small. </p>

<p>Equally charming is the NEO-computer interface: plug the NEO in via USB and the computer will recognize it as a keyboard. So you open Word or Scrivener or your favorite text program on your computer, put the cursor where you want the text and press “send” on the NEO. Suddenly the computer thinks the NEO is a keyboard where someone is typing at around 200 words per minute. </p>

<p>And that is the <em>whole point</em> of the device. It’s focused, so it can do it’s “one thing” well. It’s rugged, so it can go camping. It’s inexpensive, so if it turns out that taking it camping was a bad idea you can replace it without too much heartache. And did I mention that it’s a very <em>focused</em> device? When you are writing on a NEO you can’t be sneaking peeks at your email, or twitter or anything else. All you can do is write. It’s the perfect middle step between a paper notebook and a MacBook.</p>

<p>It also imparts a strange and wonderful sense of detachment from the writing grind. Everything you write disappears off the top of the screen in a matter of moments, leaving you with just your most recent thought and maybe the conclusion of the one before it. More than once I have written for an hour or less, and felt like I got a little bit done, plugged the NEO into my computer and watched as thousands of words pour out across the page. Turns out it’s easier to be productive when you’re not worrying about your productivity. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/03/why-oyster-books-isnt-for-me/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-03T09:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2014/03/03/why-oyster-books-isnt-for-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>…yet. </p>

<p>Last Saturday I opened an account. The next day I closed it.</p>

<p>On the surface <a href="https://www.oysterbooks.com/">Oyster Books</a> looks like a great thing: pay $10 every month and get access to a growing library of books. This, you would think, is basically playing right to my wheelhouse. I love books, I love reading, and I love eBooks on my mobile devices. </p>

<p>But it’s not for me. Why is that?</p>

<p>I mean, $9.95 isn’t bad; it’s kinda-sorta the same price as Netflix, and I read far more than I watch in a given month. I could easily read four or five books every month and it would probably be a good thing, right?</p>

<p>Except…</p>

<p>Except what <em>kind</em> of books are on the service? I have a hard enough time finding books I consider “worth reading” on iBooks or Kindle. Anything that is older than the digital age and not über mainstream tends to get forgotten. Anything that has slipped into the public domain is spammed out on the store, thousands of copies, most of them terrible OCR transfers that were never read or reviewed before being shoved onto the store to make a few bucks. </p>

<p>And from what I’ve seen Oyster hasn’t really drawn a different crowd. They have a number of recent best sellers, but a much shallower back bench than the other services, once you remove the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenburg</a> rips that everyone has. Oyster has a single Bill Bryson book, the other services have most of his catalog. I could keep going, but the odds are my numbers will all be wrong in a day or two. The <em>point</em> is that I spent a few hours searching Oyster’s catalog for things I really <em>wanted</em> to read and came up with a single book.</p>

<p>But “worth reading” can be a dangerous phrase, and it’s one that doesn’t really sound like <em>me</em> to me. I have spent my life reading just about everything I come across. I’m an author myself, and I should therefore want to stoke the fires of my own literary career by pulling in the best of everyone else’s, right?</p>

<p>Well, yeah. But my time is limited. I work eight hours a day and spend six hours trying to build and maintain a relationship with my wife and kiddos. I squeeze in exercise, games and writing around the edges of this by sleeping between five and seven hours a night. So if I’m going to read a book it needs to be worth the precious minutes I give it. And here’s where a lesson I learned years ago comes back into play.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager I got hired by Bookstar, a small bookstore that was a subsidiary of Barnes and Noble. Shortly after I started at Bookstar we moved into a full-fledged Barnes and Noble superstore. It was a flagship store for the region, and was bigger than any two libraries I had ever visited in my young life. During the early days I would walk through the store in sheer wonder, feeling the immensity of the world’s wisdom, collected around me. I was in heaven. I was surrounded by all that was best and brightest in the world of words.</p>

<p>Except…I wasn’t. The world’s greatest books <em>were</em> in there; we had the entire Loeb Classical Library, both Greek and Latin; the works of Proust and cummings Chesterton and Wodehouse and Feynman and Hawking and Picasso and Miles Davis (in our music department, of course) and the upcoming geniuses as well. But they were thin on the ground compared to the romance novels, serial mysteries, spin-off sci-fi, brainless self-help books<sup id="fnref:disclaimer"><a href="#fn:disclaimer" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>…all the books that look very impressive until you realize that they weren’t written to increase the sum total of human knowledge, they were written to increase the publisher’s bottom line. For every masterpiece that was turned out because the author had a story that <em>must be told</em> there were thirty books that were trying to capitalize on the latest blockbuster. </p>

<p>And I read them. As an employee I was allowed to check books out from the shelves with the understanding that if I bent it I bought it<sup id="fnref:noBend"><a href="#fn:noBend" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I picked things up joyfully from just about every shelf and read and read and read…and realized that a lot of what I read wasn’t making my life better. I wasn’t any happier, I wasn’t any smarter or any more connected to my fellow human beings. I was just…older. But reading is addictive; even if you’re not in love with the book you’re reading you can still enjoy the experience. So I kept just reading anything, working my way through series after series of 300-page fantasy titles that had all the intelligence of a sitcom, but slower, or through 1,100 page epics that were anything but.</p>

<p>Finally I told myself that my time was worth more, and I needed to read things that were “worth reading”. I got myself a list of “great books” and started into it. Some resonated with me, some didn’t. Some were amazing and some had aged poorly enough that I couldn’t really follow them and lost interest. I still picked up light fantasy titles now and again, but I was determined to change.</p>

<p>So now I generally only read things that I feel have a real point or enough artistry to be worth the time. I say generally, but it’s easy to relapse. I fully recognize that some of my favorite books in recent years are entirely devoid of anything resembling substance or style. And that’s where I get back around to why I probably shouldn’t sign (back) up for Oyster, at least not yet:</p>

<p>I would start reading crap again. </p>

<p>If I was paying ten bucks for a service I would make sure I was getting “my money’s worth” out of the service by ploughing through at least two or three books each month. And I would <em>love</em> it. But I don’t think it would be good for me. </p>

<p>Instead, I’ll just set aside $10 a month for new books. Buying one every a month is about right, and gives me time to catch up on my huge library at home. </p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:disclaimer">
      <p>There are many excellent mystery novels and good sci-fi and good self-help books, I know. But for every good one there are two dozen mindless filler titles that were written by committee. <a href="#fnref:disclaimer" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

I’ve <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">mentioned before</a> that I go through three phases as I get used to a new program: <em>Inquiry</em>, <em>Inquisition</em> and <em>Investment</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Inquiry</em> phase is the “does it do what I want it to do, without being irritating?” phase. Basically this is like a caveman poking a thing with a sharp stick, hiding behind a rock to see if it tries to bite him, then biting <em>it</em> to see if it’s worth eating.</p>

  <p>If a program gets past that, then comes the <em>Inquisition</em>: “Oh yeah, well can you handle <em>this</em>? What about <em>that</em>? And how do you like the <em>comfy chair</em>?”</p>

  <p>Anything that makes it past the Inquisition with any level of approval gets my <em>Investment</em>, the phase where I put the time into learning how to use the program to its fullest and really start using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve put VoodooPad through the wringer before. Searching through my email reveals that I have a version 2 license<sup id="fnref:password"><a href="#fn:password" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I liked the idea, the core of VoodooPad back then, but it never got past the Inquisition. I could see that it <em>wanted</em> to do things right, but we never <em>clicked</em>. </p>

<p>Still, when I got the email that VoodooPad had left its original home at Flying Meat I was kinda saddened. It may not have been my cup of tea, but it was still an amazing product and it’s cool in a way that is hard to put into words. Don’t get me wrong, I think Gus of Flying Meat made the right choice when he decided to <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2013/11/a_new_home_for_voodoopad.html">sell VoodooPad</a>. If he doesn’t feel he can maintain it any more nobody would know better than he would. </p>

<p>The new owners at <a href="https://plausible.coop/">Plausible Labs</a> have promised to make it better and take great care of it, because they love VoodooPad and want to see it grow. That’s great news. </p>

<p>But can I trust it?</p>

<p>There’s two questions there: Can I trust Plausible Labs to keep making VoodooPad better, and can I trust VoodooPad to be good enough to deserve my investment?</p>

<p>For the record I’ve already purchased my license; so we’re not talking about <em>financial</em> investment. I’m talking about investing my time, which is far more valuable these days. (“oh, look at Mr. Moneybags!” Yeah, yeah, you know what I meant.)</p>

<p>So, second question first: Can I trust VoodooPad, the program, to be what I want it to be?</p>

<h2 id="trusting-the-program">Trusting the Program</h2>

<p>This is the bigger of the two questions. After all, if VoodooPad is good enough to use and invest in now it doesn’t need a lot of updates all the time. My beloved Scrivener gets (I would say) <em>Just enough</em> updates: Not every month, but every so often. And even if updates stopped tomorrow I would keep using it until it no longer worked on whatever Mac I was using in the far future. </p>

<p>So I’ve started the process. I would say I’m near the end of the Inquisition phase right now. And what I’ve found is hopeful. Coming to version 5 of VoodooPad from version 2 left me refreshingly free of preconceived notions about the program: I knew it was a “Personal Wiki” and that’s about it. </p>

<p>Markdown support has entered the mix since last I checked the app, and even better, it seems to fully understand MultiMarkdown<sup id="fnref:mmd"><a href="#fn:mmd" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is a huge win. Simple Markdown like headings, strong, italic, etc. are all handled correctly and shown while you’re editing the text. </p>

<p>The other <em>sine qua non</em> for a personal wiki that I had is inter-page links that just <em>appear</em> without any additional markup/markdown/whatever. When I type the name of another page I want it to be clickable. VoodooPad does that with aplomb. </p>

<p>So, as a personal wiki it’s doing what I want it to do. <em>Check</em>. </p>

<p>And there’s a lot more that I haven’t fully explored yet<sup id="fnref:investment"><a href="#fn:investment" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, like in-app scripting in Python, JSTalk, Ruby, shell, etc. and other potentially useful things like tagging, collections, built-in todo list collection…it’s basically the kitchen sink. </p>

<p>But there’s one huge dark spot: the iOS version of the app. It’s definitely been lacking in love or attention for years now. It’s not iOS 7-compiled, and most of the UI looks more like iOS 4. It doesn’t seem to open my main document, and it has separate editing/reading modes, thus getting rid of the main good thing I see in the desktop version. But, again, Plausible promises that improvments are coming. Which leads us to the second point: Trusting the company.</p>

<h2 id="trusting-plausible-labs">Trusting Plausible Labs</h2>

<p>This is where I have a bigger problem. It’s not that I think they’re incompetent, or lazy, or bad developers or anything. Just as I believe Gus knew when to get out of VoodooPad, I also believe that he didn’t hand it over to someone who would mess it up. But it’s not their baby. </p>

<p>I’m not saying I think they’ll let it languish, but they need to know that now is a very sensitive period for the product. They shouldn’t rush any bug fixes or new features just for the sake of putting out a new version, but semi-regular updates on the blog about how the work is coming, some notification that they <em>are</em> working on it would go a long way to build confidence.<sup id="fnref:clockwork"><a href="#fn:clockwork" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>That said, I’m going to <em>Invest</em>-with-a-capital-I in VoodooPad. And I great hopes of seeing Plausible Labs do great things with it. I just hope we don’t have to wait too long. </p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/30/fluency/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-30T08:12:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/30/fluency</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 1998 I served an <a href="http://mormon.org/values/missionary-work">LDS Mission</a> to the Philippines. Those of you who are familiar with how LDS missionaries operate know the drill: you spend ten weeks learning the language in a classroom setting and then you get sent out with a more experienced missionary to try it on your own. And anyone who has ever tried to speak a language they’ve only heard in a classroom setting knows what comes next: you spend a lot of time staring at people who speak a language you thought you were pretty good at, and you have no idea what they’re saying. </p>

<p>So I set myself some goals. I wanted to laugh at a Tagalog joke, because I actually understood it. I wanted to get my accent to be less terrible<sup id="fnref:accent"><a href="#fn:accent" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I wanted to actually think in Tagalog. These were little stepping stones I set for myself, goals I was trying to reach to show that I was actually gaining some actual fluency in the language. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="&#8220;Kaya ko ito!&#8221;">
And then, one night a few months after I landed in Manila I had a thought, just three words that came to me as I was walking across the town square: “Kaya ko ito!” That was it. In English<sup id="fnref:sorta"><a href="#fn:sorta" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it’s “I can do this”.  But that’s not the point. The point was that I had the thought <em>in Tagalog</em> instead of having it in English and translating it. I had a long way to go, but it was clear that something was happening, and I was learning something. Since then that thought has come back to me from time to time when I’m trying to do something difficult. I’ll start in one something, bang my head against the wall for a while, and all of a sudden there will be a moment of clarity, a brief glimpse of the summit after the first day’s climb, and the words “Kaya ko ito” will come back into my head. I can do this.
</span></p>

<p>One of those difficult things has been learning vim. While I’ve been teaching myself to use it<sup id="fnref:painlessplug"><a href="#fn:painlessplug" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I’ve had a lot of moments where it just seemed too hard, too useless, and I had to set myself some goals. They were simpler goals, things like “don’t lose half a file and have to restore it from my git backups again today”, and then more useful goals, like “actually use the search and replace engine,” followed shortly by “actually use vim’s regex engine without the <code>very magic</code> flag”. Litte steps to show that I was making progress. </p>

<p>And one day, just a little while ago, I had a simple task ahead of me: remove the last three arguments from a function declaration. Without really thinking about it I got my cursor inside the parentheses and since my cursor was just before the closing paren I typed</p>

<pre><code>d3F,
</code></pre>

<p>And that was it. In English<sup id="fnref:kinda"><a href="#fn:kinda" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> it’s “delete back through the third comma before the cursor”. But that’s not the point. The point is that I just <em>did</em> it, without looking at a cheat sheet, without using help, without standing there for two minutes trying to figure out how to do what I knew I wanted to do. It was the “Kaya kong ito” moment all over again. I know I’ve still got a lot of vim to learn, but it’s clear that something is happening, and I’m learning something.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-05T10:20:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/05/not-during-but-due-to-nanowrimo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year marks my sixth year participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, and I’ve started wondering if there was really a <em>point</em> to writing a “novel” in a single month. Especially since I haven’t really developed any of them beyond the rough draft I wrote in November. </p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/images/nano_win.png" title="National Novel Writing Month Winner" alt="National Novel Writing Month Winner" /> So, I “won” again this year, writing a book that I have absolutely no desire to pursue further. Which has made me wonder if I’m doing it wrong or if I need to maybe just give up on NaNoWriMo because it’s not helping me grow as a “real” writer. But then I realized something.</p>

<p>I never would have written <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em> if I hadn’t been taking part of NaNoWriMo every year. <em>Painless Vim</em> isn’t a novel, it’s not a wild flight of fancy that I pounded out in a month.<sup id="fnref:supposed"><a href="#fn:supposed" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  But there are a lot of things I learned from NaNoWriMo that made it possible for me to write <em>Painless Vim</em>. Some of the most important are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Write every day. This is the first and only secret of writing, of course. </li>
  <li>Write your first draft like nobody is going to read it, because nobody <em>is</em> going to read it. You’ll revise it into something better. </li>
  <li>Write for yourself. There are others out there who are in the same place as you, and they’ll appreciate what you’ve written. </li>
  <li>Use Scrivener. <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">I absolutely <em>love</em> Scrivener</a>, and six years of NaNo’ing has made it as comfortable as a well-worn pair of blue jeans for me. If I get up the energy I’ll write a post about how my Scrivener workflow looks one of these days. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I’m not saying that I’m the world’s best author. But I wrote a book and put it out there where people can buy it, which is something that never would have happened if it hadn’t been for National Novel Writing Month. And that’s enough to keep me coming back year after year.</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/01/excerpt-from-pacifica/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-01T07:59:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/12/01/excerpt-from-pacifica</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the best study of my main character, the one that I think most accurately captures who she thinks she is. </p>

<hr />

<p>The roadway sparkles and flows with light, a jeweled strand across the dark landscape. Cylee sat far up on a hill, the fresh, wild wind blowing her hair back. </p>

<p>She used to live in this place, this quiet, dark, outdoor world. Back before Pacifica, before the war…</p>

<p>The strings of lights eventually merge into the cities, connecting the nets of lights that represent civilization, mankind’s crowning jewels shining in the dark. And once you’re caught in that net it can feel like there’s nothing else, no other way to live. You can learn to depend on the Network, constant wireless streams of information flowing into and out of you at all times. You can learn to read the streets as you read the trees, feel the way the social wind is blowing just as you used to know how to read the fitful pre-dawn breezes. </p>

<p>And, in truth, Cylee was caught by that net. If she stayed out here for a few days or weeks her Spine would shut down and go from being an Augmentation to being thirty pounds of stiff dead metal. She’d be essentially blinded and deafened, her limbs left to their own strength. Even now she was half blind, her Spine out of range of the Network and therefore unable to give her the kind of information that made up the background noise of her daily life. Granted, she could still see every living, warm blooded thing that moved in the darkness, every rabbit, every bat, every bird was a blip on her augmented vision, their insane heart rates pounding like miniature thunder in her ears. </p>

<p>But she used to track them unaided. Used to be able to sense the movement of creatures that were string to remain hidden. She could feel the twitch in the grass that didn’t <em>quite</em> match the way the wind was moving. And she would raise her bow quietly, wait for the next movement…and…with a soft twang she would have breakfast.</p>

<p>Out of a sense of irony and frustration she considered raising her flechette thrower and pinning that rabbit to the ground, letting her Spine handle the fine details of getting her hand in the right position, but she stopped, realized she didn’t need the meat, and shouldn’t waste it. Pacifica had made her a perfect soldier, but it hadn’t entirely removed the true hunter she had been. </p>

    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/11/11/writing-with-my-head-in-the-sand</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a saying about marriage that you should find a spouse with your eyes wide open and stay with a spouse with your eyes half shut.<sup id="fnref:source"><a href="#fn:source" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve found this to be helpful advice about more than just marriage; when I buy a new computer I spend months reading reviews and write ups on the all the components involved and scouring the world for the best prices. Once I buy my components I all but block those sites on my browser; I don’t <em>want</em> to know that a brand new video card came out the same day my suddenly obsolete one arrives at my door. I just want to be happy with what I bought.</p>

<p>And, in an odd way it’s turning out to be true about writing <em><a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>. There are two books and a few websites that I used quite a bit while I was starting to learn vim, they are somehow on my “okay” list. But any site or book I haven’t read yet is now <em>the enemy</em>, because I’m afraid they’re all better than the book I’m writing and I’ll have to die now. There are (at least) <a href="https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro">two</a> <a href="https://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway">other</a> vim books already on Leanpub.com; I can’t look at them too directly lest I discover the only thing my book has that the don’t is a whimsical cover. </p>

<p>And, of course, what does it matter? If other books are better that’s fine; I can hope that there are some people out there who will get what they need out of my little book. So I’m keeping my head in the sand a little bit. Some day I’ll be done writing <em>Painless Vim</em> and I’ll be able to read other people’s vim books.</p>

<p>There’s no real point here; just a little note about how my mind seems to work when I’m mid-book like this.</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/10/31/my-nanowrimo-cover-for-this-year/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-31T11:34:00-06:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/pacifica_cover.jpg" width="250" title="Pacifica Cover" />
This is a super-short post to show off what I&rsquo;m going to be working on for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> this year. </p>

<p>I know that <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/">Painless Vim</a></em> isn&rsquo;t finished yet, although it&rsquo;s very close, and basically all I&rsquo;m doing is a little bit of cleanup and formatting. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting with baited breath for <em>Painless Vim</em> to be finished fear not! I will still be working on the Little Vim Book that Could during the month of November. In fact, my goal is to have it completely finished. By December 1st, even while I&rsquo;m &ldquo;winning&rdquo; NaNoWriMo for the sixth straight year. </p>

<p>In previous years I&rsquo;ve been doing graduate level classes, having babies<sup id="fnref:babies"><a href="#fn:babies" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and changing jobs during NaNoWriMo, and I&rsquo;ve always found time to make it work. What&rsquo;s more, the impetus it gives me tends to help me get more done in the rest of my life as well. The saying about giving work to busy people still holds true. If I turn myself into a busy person I tend to be more capable overall. Until I freak out and melt down, of course. So I guess there&rsquo;s still something to be said for balance. </p>

<h2 id="more-about-pacifica">More About Pacifica</h2>

<p>Which is all very nice, but you may possibly be interested in the book cover I&rsquo;m showing off here. You&rsquo;ve got questions, no doubt. Questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who designed your cover?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you be willing to let me redesign your cover, because it&rsquo;s pretty bad?&rdquo; </p>

<p>The answers are &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute&rdquo;, &ldquo;I did in about two hours using Pixelmator&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in that order. I like playing with Pixelmator, but I&rsquo;m not super great with it, and if there&rsquo;s a graphic designer out there who wants to take a second pass at this I&rsquo;d be happy to let you. </p>

<p>The book is my first foray into cyberpunk. It&rsquo;s a near-future look at what&rsquo;s its like to be on the losing side of a war for independence, and how to keep your pride even when you&rsquo;ve got nothing left to be proud of. </p>

<p>If I remember (and have time) I&rsquo;ll probably post excerpts through the month. Wether or not I actually develop <em>Pacifica</em> after November remains to be seen, but if I&rsquo;ve learned anything from five successful NaNo&rsquo;s its that even writing an ultimately wasted story isn&rsquo;t wasted effort. I&rsquo;ve learned something from every book I&rsquo;ve written.</p>

    <link href="http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/09/17/using-nvalt-as-a-personal-wiki/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-17T06:37:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://natedickson.com/blog/2013/09/17/using-nvalt-as-a-personal-wiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://natedickson.com/assets/images/nvALT.png" title="nvALT icon" />
One of the best things about <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> is that it gives you a lot of tools you can use with little to no friction. You can use tags, or not, you can store your files in dropbox as individual markdown files, or you can keep them all in a single database<sup id="fnref:database"><a href="#fn:database" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s all up to you. It&rsquo;s very liberal about how you use its powers.</p>

<p>Which means I missed one.</p>

<p>Up until now I&rsquo;ve been using nvALT as my repository of code and notes on projects, useful tips and hints and things that I tend to forget. You know, all the stuff that makes nvALT great. The praises of nvALT have already been sung, and sung better than I will sing them here. But here&rsquo;s what I just discovered: the inter-note linking feature. </p>

<p><strong>OH. MAN.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, those of you who already knew about this can just go ahead and laugh at me. But for those of you who haven&rsquo;t discovered this yet, it&rsquo;s very very simple and powerful. Just wrap the name of another note in <code>[[double brackets]]</code> and you have a link to that note. What&rsquo;s more, once you open the double brackets you can start typing the name of a file and nvALT will autocomplete it for you.</p>

<p>With this addition, nvALT has supplanted VoodooPad, EverNote, and my <a href="https://github.com/PogiNate/SublimeWiki">own home-brew Sublime Text Wiki system</a>. Not only is it more flexible, but it also has one of the best built-in markdown previews ever. </p>

Just a quick post to happily note that <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com">Days of Wonder</a> has finally updated their <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/small-world-for-ipad/id364165557?mt=8">Small World app</a> on the iPad. Small World was the first game I bought on the original iPad, and it&rsquo;s been sadly neglected for a quite a while. </p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s back in business now! It&rsquo;s beautifully, fully retina, has new content (available through an in app purchase), and now lets you play with up to five people via pass &amp; play, or you can have the one on one experience that you&rsquo;re used to from the original version. I&rsquo;ve always loved Days Of Wonder&rsquo;s games, and they continue to do a great job bringing them to the iPad. Thanks guys!</p>
