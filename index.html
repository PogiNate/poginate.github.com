  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was brushing up on some JavaScript for work and came across a problem that has bugged me before: testing for <code>NaN</code><sup id="fnref:notANumber"><a href="#fn:notANumber" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I’ve never dug too deeply into this one, I’ve just known that if you try something like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">NaN</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">NaN</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class="line">   <span class="c1">//a is NaN, do something</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">   <span class="c1">//a is a number, do something else</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The code would always do something else. so I usually found a different way to solve the problem. </p>

<p>Today I actually dug into it and found that in JavaScript the value <code>NaN</code> has some odd properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s a number.</li>
  <li>It is the one value in JavaScript that can never equal itself. </li>
</ol>

<p>So that’s annoying, but actually lends itself to a very easy solution: if you want to test if a variable is <code>NaN</code> you can test it like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="c1">// a is NaN</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="c1">// a is a number</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>But people who are good at JavaScript already know this. This is not news. </p>

<p>What struck me about this is that Douglas Adams invented a word for this kind of value: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. 
Douglas Adams, *The Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (p. 345). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. *</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow this made me actually like JavaScript more. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/U2_Songs_of_Innocence_cover.jpg" title="Songs of Innocence Cover Image" /></p>

<p>News of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/apple-puts-up-support-page-to-get-u2-album-out-of-your-itunes/">backlash</a> against U2’s <em>Songs of Innocence</em> has reached the North Pole. Santa Claus today has released a statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a time when people enjoyed having an old guy sneak into their house and give them free stuff. As my good friends Paul [Hewson] and Tim [Cook] have seen, that time has passed. So I am warning anyone who decides to use the “<a href="http://itunes.com/soi-remove">remove <em>Songs of Innocence</em></a>” tool. I wanted to announce that I will also be removing your name from my list of annual visits. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="we-were-young-not-dumb">We Were Young, Not Dumb</h2>

<p>I like U2, although their last couple of albums have been a long downhill slide and it’s unlikely that I would have purchased this one. So in one sense, I’m okay with Apple buying the new album and giving it to me <em>gratis</em>. </p>

<p>And I suspect that for a lot of people the album itself isn’t the problem. As one of my friends put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…for me, it’s a weird boundary issue. Like, I’m fine with someone sending me a free CD in the mail, I’m less fine with a CD randomly appearing on my coffee table while I’m at work. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of us like reminders that our devices are only “ours” on the surface. We try not to acknowledge that Apple<sup id="fnref:android"><a href="#fn:android" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> reigns supreme on the device. We like the illusion of security and privacy, and anything that erodes that illusion creeps us out. </p>

<p>For others, of course, the album <em>is</em> the problem. I trust Apple to allow me to buy whatever music, books, movies, and apps I want without censorship or oversight<sup id="fnref:with"><a href="#fn:with" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I want them to keep my music library safe, and keep it <em>mine</em>. I don’t want them dictating what constitutes “good music” to me. I like U2, so I’m not bothered by this particular album. But if Apple had shoved a John Meyer or Beyoncé or (more plausibly) Dr. Dré album into my iTunes library I would have been incensed. </p>

<p>So, Bono Claus, if you’re reading this<sup id="fnref:nope"><a href="#fn:nope" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: next time you want to give us something for free please just <em>knock</em> instead of coming down the chimney. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was going through some old scraps of things I’ve written and found this brainstorming list of possible titles for my  <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">then-upcoming book on vim.</a> before I settled on the current title.

<h2 id="vim-book-titles">Vim Book Titles</h2>

<ul>

<p>I really liked <em>Long Day’s Journey into Vim</em>, but that cover would have been <em>hideous</em> and it didn’t really have the “friendly and breezy” vibe I was going for. Ditto <em>Reluctant Vim</em>. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/opera_icon.png" title="The Opera Browser" /></p>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>. I love that they’ve kept the faith, kept making an actual for-profit browser for decades, long after the browser crown has gone to, well,  <em>everyone else</em> over and over. I love that their little team keeps after it, keeps trying, and keeps making the most innovative browsers on the market, and then <em>doesn’t</em> turn around and sue everyone else for copying their best features<sup id="fnref:bestFeatures"><a href="#fn:bestFeatures" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Back when IE 6 was still the reigning champion and Firefox was still called Firebird I actually paid for an Opera license, and I would do it again in a heartbeat if they went back to a paid browser model. </p>

<p>Over the years, however, I have used the other darlings of browser-land, like everyone else. Firefox was my browser of choice for years, followed in due course by Chrome, and recently another stint with the ‘Fox, when it became obvious that Chrome was basically just inviting the NSA and advertisers to look over your shoulder the entire time you’re on the internet. </p>

<p>And I’ve loved my time with Firefox. No, it’s not as fast as Chrome. It never will be. But it’s (finally) also not as memory hungry, and is actually a pretty good citizen. And Firebug is a developer’s dream, of course. All in all it’s a very solid browser, and I have no real complaints. </p>

<p>So why leave? What changed my mind? </p>

<h2 id="heading-for-the-coast">Heading for the Coast</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/coast_icon.png" title="The Opera Coast icon" /></p>

<p>There are a couple of things. The first one was <a href="http://operacoast.com">Opera Coast</a>, the world’s most interesting browser. Opera once again decided to take a look at what a browser UI should look like and decided that everything that had happened up to this point was wrong and started over. Coast operates under the assumption that either you are going to go to one of the four or five (or ten or twelve…it doesn’t judge) sites you always go to on your mobile device and shows you those. It says this right on the website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don’t care what you do with your time. We just want to make sure that if you decide to waste a little, you do it well. And, there’s no better browser to help you pass some free time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything about Opera Coast is tuned to this ideology. You’re probably going to waste a few minutes on one of your regular sites. That’s cool, here’s an icon for it. But what if you want to go to a <em>different</em> site? Well, if you are going somewhere new you are going to do a search, right? Okay, pull down to search. Watch the awesome search thingy figure out what you’re looking for and start pre-loading sites while you’re still typing. And if you’re feeling even less directed the search area will show you a list of good time wasting sites without searching at all, a feature I have used more than once. If you decide you like one of these new sites you have the option of adding a chip to the home screen, making it that much easier to come back to the next time you have a few moments to kill. </p>

<p>All the techy parts of the browser are gone. You don’t have an address bar. When you are on a page there is zero chrome around the page except a little shortcut back to the home screen. All the interactions are intuitive and fluid. Opera has made a browser that actually makes sense on a phone. </p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-desk">Back to the Desk</h2>

<p>So, having discovered Coast, I decided to see what desktop Opera looks like these days. It’s been a few years since I’ve tried it out, and it deserved another look. And a lot of the end-user consideration that has gone into Coast has gone into the desktop browser as well. Speed Dial, another Opera invention, has had a facelift and now is almost iPad-like in it’s use of tiles and folders. The new “Stash” feature lets you grab pages that you are visiting frequently for a while and keep them organized and visible. I can see this being helpful if you’re following a particular event and want to keep some sites handy while that event is going on, but once it’s over you can clear it out of your Stash and move on. This is definitely a psychological divide (it’s not that hard to delete bookmarks) but it works well. </p>

<p>And, again, if you’re just looking to kill some time you’ve got a Discover tab a la Coast. </p>

<p>Under the hood, Opera is using WebKit, the same engine that powers Chrome and Safari, so it’s sufficiently speedy and does all the typical browser stuff just fine. But the additional thoughtful touches in the UI have made it my current browser of choice. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/Overcast_iphone.png" width="256" height="256" title="The Overcast App Icon" /></p>

<p>Back when I first got an iPod Touch I was <em>way</em> into podcasts. There were some weirdly terrible ones back then that <em>changed me</em>, man. But for a while my biggest reason for listening to podcasts was because I was commuting, and I needed something brain-stimulating while I was on the road. Ever since I moved closer to my worksite, however, I&rsquo;ve been doing far less with podcasts, and I realized that I actually miss it. So I decided to get back into it.</p>

<p>My mistake, unfortunately, was that I did some <em>research</em> before trying to get back into podcasts. I should have just downloaded the apple podcasts app and gone on from there. But that&rsquo;s not my style. Long story short, I didn&rsquo;t really listen to any podcasts <strong>at all</strong> for a few months while I decided which app I wanted to use. In my wanderings I discovered that Marco Arment of Instapaper fame was making a new podcasting app called <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>. This made me happy; I have loved Instapaper for years<sup id="fnref:untilPocket"><a href="#fn:untilPocket" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I respect his appreciation for minimal presentation around the content.</p>

<p>So I waited for Overcast to actually come out, again, putting off my dive back into the world o&rsquo; podcasts. I played with <a href="http://downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> for a while, but wasn&rsquo;t in love with it. </p>

<p>So, Overcast came out, and I wasted no time downloading it and getting back into the world of people talking at their computers. </p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m quite impressed<sup id="fnref:both"><a href="#fn:both" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Every part of Overcast shows signs of methodical, reasoned, intelligent design and execution. Which is quite a claim to make of a podcast player, I realize. I mean, all it has to do is mash an RSS reader with an audio player, right? </p>

<p>Well, sure, but you can do so much better. Podcast listeners have gotten used to a few things; they want their shows intelligently managed, downloaded (and removed) according to a schedule and without undue fussing. They want to be able to speed up speech-only podcasts, because you can listen much faster than people can speak. They want to find new and interesting things to listen to in-app. </p>

<p>And Overcast provides all of this, with aplomb. Everything is simple, easy to hand, and easy to use. But they added a few nice touches that I haven&rsquo;t seen elsewhere. My favorite is &ldquo;Smart Speed&rdquo;, which intelligently goes through and deletes pauses and breaks in the conversation, but in a very natural way. I have literally  no idea how it does it, and indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure it <em>was</em> doing it for the first few times I used it, because everything sounded so natural. Occasionally it will get stuck in the middle of someone&rsquo;s vocal gesturing and make them sound a bit robotic, but this is rare. For the most part it just saves me time without getting in the way. </p>

<p>And Overcast includes even more awesomeness in the form of the <a href="https://overcast.fm">overcast.fm</a> website. If you set up an account it will keep track of your status across devices, and also gives you a web player which also stays in sync. I created a <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid app</a> for Overcast on my macbook pro, which lets me listen transition from the iPhone to the desktop without missing a beat. </p>

<p>Finishing off the excellent features of Overcast is Marco himself. the <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM">@Overcast</a> twitter account is where he responds to user requests and questions, and he is <em>listening</em>, yo. Overcast is evolving based on user feedback, quickly and, again, intelligently. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to all the amazing people who bought <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/"><em>Painless Vim</em></a> I’ve got a little bit of spare cash to put into things that make my job easier. I’ve had my eye on one such convenience for quite some time now: a customized mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/full_keyboard.png" title="My beautifully custom keyboard." /></p>

<p>For those of you who aren’t insane, mechanical keyboards are a <em>big deal</em> these days, amongst people who think too much about their working setup. If you want to know more about why mechanical is the way to go I suggest reading this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-the-best-mechanical-keyboard-and-why-you-511140347">excellent article on Lifehacker</a> that covers it nicely. </p>

<p><em>Anyway</em> when my recent royalty check came in from Leanpub I realized I was finally in the position to fulfill an old dream of mine: buy a fully customized, fully mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>A few years ago I found out about a company called <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD Keyboards</a>, and they are delightfully obsessed with making top of the line keyboards that fit <em>you</em>. Not you, the general purpose programmer, not “you” the one-size-fits-all gamer,  <strong>you</strong>, individually. If you want your keys to be in alternate rows of white and  yellow they can do that for you. If you want all your keys totally blank, the <code>HJKL</code> keys red and everything else black, that’s cool, they’re on it. However you want to do it, <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/gallery">they will do it</a>. You can design your dream keyboard on their website, choosing from several different key layouts, and the ability to specifically color every single key on the board. If the customization on the site isn’t specific enough you can send them a file with <em>exactly</em> how you want every key printed, and they will do it.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/extra_ctrl.png" title="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" alt="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" /></p>

<p>And it gets better. WASD is in the business of keyboards and keyboards only, and they listen to their customers. The <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-104-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html#ad-image-0">V2 models</a> have a series of DIP switches on the bottom that let you customize all the good stuff. Things like “Make <code>Caps Lock</code> into a third <code>Ctrl</code> button” for us vim fans.<sup id="fnref:notice"><a href="#fn:notice" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  Things like “swap the <code>Alt</code> and <code>OS</code> keys” for us OSX fans. Things like “Switch to Colemak or Dvorak” for people who take their typing seriously<sup id="fnref:notyet"><a href="#fn:notyet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. All these switches are handled on the keyboard itself, so you don’t have to mess around with system settings. </p>

<p>If you are crazy like me and care about the details, I got this keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches, which have a nice tactile bump halfway down, at the actuation point. If you understood that sentence, welcome to the club of people who should sleep more and study keyboards less. Pull up a chair. If you didn’t, it’s nerd speak for saying “I can push the keys halfway down and they register, which is easier on your fingers, and when they register there’s a little bump you can feel letting you know the key registered.”</p>

<p>The build quality is quite high<sup id="fnref:CODEKeyboard"><a href="#fn:CODEKeyboard" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> from what I’ve seen so far, with a nice weight to the keyboard, excellent motion on every single key, and sharp, laser-etched inscriptions on every keycap. </p>

<p>I guess if there is a point to this post it’s twofold: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Thank you, All of you, who have supported me in my writing.</li>
  <li>If you’re looking at getting a mechanical keyboard you should seriously consider WASD Keyboards. You won’t be disappointed. </li>
</ol>

<p>And now, back to work on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux/"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a>! 😃</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been working on <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_tmux">Painless Tmux</a> and trying to apply a lot of what I learned while writing <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a> to make the process easier and more streamlined. </p>

<p>And one of the problems that I’ve been beating my head against is this:</p>

<p>Tables. </p>

<p>Tables in Markdown are a mess. Understandably so, because you’re trying to keep everything nicely lined up in plain text, which just doesn’t happen. Compound that with proportional fonts in Scrivener and you have something that nobody should ever have to look at. There’s a couple of problems here, of course. </p>

<p>The first is that it’s easy for bugs to hide in messy code<sup id="fnref:orText"><a href="#fn:orText" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I’ve had to run my manuscript files through Leanpub’s markdown generator multiple times before I got my tables right. </p>

<p>So: step one: after putting all the data in a table let’s get the table all lined up and looking nice. This is where vim steps in. Specifically, vim with the <a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a> plugin. </p>

<p>Using Tabular I can turn a table that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |  
|  ------ | ------ |  
| some text | A second bit o' text |   
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text	| 
</code></pre>

<p>into this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1                                        | Heading 2            |
| ------                                           | ------               |
| some text                                        | A second bit o' text |
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text           |
</code></pre>

<p>all by typing <code>:Tab /|</code> in vim<sup id="fnref:learnMore"><a href="#fn:learnMore" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So far so good. But when I paste this back into Scrivener it looks terrible again, because Scrivener uses proportional fonts<sup id="fnref:myScriv"><a href="#fn:myScriv" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kerned-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with proportional text" /></p>

<p>This was an even easier problem to solve, I just didn’t realize it it until today. Scrivener lets you use all kinds of rich text features while writing, all of which it ignores when exporting or compiling your text for output. This means, of course, that I can style my tables with a monospaced font and suddenly they line up the way they were supposed to all along. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/monospaced-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with Monospaced text" /></p>

<p>But changing the fonts manually every time I make a table is a drag. Enter the “presets” feature that Scrivener uses. Its basically the Apple “Styles” menu, but enhanced and made more Scrivener-like. All I had to do was highlight the monospaced section, then in the menu go to <code>Format-&gt;Formatting-&gt;New Preset From Selection</code> and now I can make any of my text nicely monospaced with the click of a button. And while I was at it I re-styled the “Body” preset to be the the way I (currently) like it. </p>

<p>So there you have it: a couple of simple, common sense tips for making tables less of a nightmare in your Markdown manuscripts. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/pt_cover_web.png" title="Painless Tmux Cover" /></p>

<p>For about the last year I&rsquo;ve been working on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim"><em>Painless Vim</em></a>, and really enjoying it. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about writing, and of course I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about vim. But for the last little while it&rsquo;s been slowing down. I&rsquo;ve written all the text, and I&rsquo;ve been through a few rounds of revisions, both from changes made by editors and from changes suggested by readers. And now it&rsquo;s pretty much done. Sure, there are a few revisions left to make, but they&rsquo;re nothing compared to the work I&rsquo;ve been putting into it over the previous months. </p>

<p>So I decided to write <em>another</em> book. You see, I realized that, while I use vim for basically all my programming work, that&rsquo;s only half the story. Vim is great, but there&rsquo;s no real reason to use a terminal based text editor if that&rsquo;s <em>all</em> you&rsquo;re doing from the terminal. And for the past year or more, while I&rsquo;ve been learning and writing about vim, I&rsquo;ve also been using <strong>tmux</strong> to get more out of my terminal, and to compliment and augment vim&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m writing a book to compliment and augment <em>Painless Vim</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a> is brand new, and as I write this it&rsquo;s only 15 pages long. There&rsquo;s a lot of life ahead of it, and I&rsquo;m really excited about this one. For one thing, tmux is <em>so much easier</em> to use and to learn than vim. Especially if you&rsquo;re already using vim. </p>

<p>Together, vim and tmux let you do pretty much everything, all from the keyboard. so, I&rsquo;m also offering the <a href="https://leanpub.com/b/painless_productivity">two books as a bundle</a>, for significantly less than buying them separately. Basically if you buy the bundle you get <em>Painless Tmux</em> for a dollar. </p>

<p>When I started <em>Painless Vim</em> I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was getting myself into. I figured it would take a month, tops. Well, this time, I <em>do</em> know what I&rsquo;m getting myself into and I&rsquo;m excited to get into it. </p>

Heading out, leaving work. It’s about two miles home, an easy half-hour walk. What’s more, it’s all downhill. I decide to let Chicago Avenue Moon do its thing while I walk. Let’s hear some procedurally generated tunes. </p>

<p>The UI doesn’t tell me much; or rather, it <em>does</em>, but not in a way that I can understand. A string of numbers running down one side of the screen slowly starts filling in, going from all <code>0.00</code> to…other numbers. Probably based on my walking speed? A line swings across four circles, highlighting them…and that’s it. But it’s time to put the device away, time to walk. </p>

<p>The sound starts slowly…a quiet susurrous of static is all for a moment, then a gentle swell of strings, maybe?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/CAM-Screen.png" title="Screenshot from Chicago Avenue Moon" />
Slowly the sonic landscape fills in: quiet, layered sounds give way to rising waves of music. It’s like having an audio-only link to some other world. This isn’t music I’ve heard a thousand times before, this is something new and unique, being created by my walk, and it opens my eyes. </p>

<p>I’ve seen everything along this route hundreds of times, but I’m seeing it more clearly this time. Bright, living green grasses under a mottled gray cloudy sky. I’m more aware of colors than I’ve been in a long time, I’m open to the feeling of the wind…and presently the rain.</p>

<p>I pull my umbrella out of my messenger bag and pop it open, imagining what I might look like from above. A drab, office-worker colored stalk, watered by the rain, suddenly bursts into a bright red and white flower fighting the wind. </p>

<p>The sounds of wind and rain fold themselves into the music from Chicago Avenue, and in my quiet and dreamlike state it’s easy to believe that whatever mathematical equations are controlling the sounds are also orchestrating the storm, for as soon as I turn a corner the rain slows, then stops. The music, too, changes gradually, adapting to my new position and heading. The whoosh and hiss of cars driving past in the rain…it’s all one.</p>

<p>At length I turn the corner onto my street, and one by one the layers of music fall away, leaving only a slow, stately tone, rolling in grand waves, and fading slightly, a fitting end to a walk in another world. </p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/chicago-avenue-moon.html"> <em>Chicago Avenue Moon</em> </a> is an oddity on the App Store. Created by <a href="http://junecloud.com">JuneCloud</a>, who are best known for their <a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/delivery-status-touch.html"> package tracking app </a>, it’s a pure work of art, and one that succeeds. According to the website, it was originally the vision of <a href="http://quieterrors.com/">Joshua Dumas</a>, a musician who wanted to </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…help re-enchant a person’s daily commute, trip to the laundromat, or evening jog. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A worthy goal. </p>

<p>The app really does create a soundscape that is throbbing with life, full of strange, alien combinations, and occasionally overlaid with bursts of static, as if you really were channeling this music from somewhere far away.</p>

<p>It may not be the perfect soundtrack for every single day, but if you want to include a little bit of mystery into your daily wanderings it’s definitely worth a try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/NEO.jpg" width="400" height="400" title="The Alphasmart Neo in its natural habitat" />
A thing I once thought would never happen has happened twice: I have been paid for something I wrote by people who actually ponied up their own hard-earned cash to buy <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">a thing I wrote</a>. I can’t even tell you how awesome that is. If you are one of those people I thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>

<p>But that’s not what this article is about. This article is about what I did with the second royalty check I got from Leanpub a few days ago:</p>

<p>I bought an Alphasmart NEO. </p>

<p>I first became aware of the existence of these little wonders when I was reading Chris Baty’s<sup id="fnref:whoIsChris"><a href="#fn:whoIsChris" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> book “No Plot? No Problem!”. Says he:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some NaNoWriMo participants swear by an affordable machine called an Alphasmart (www.alphasmart.com). This is a battery-powered, word-processing device that looks like a cross between a laptop and a children’s Speak &amp; Spell. The miniscule screen only displays four lines of text or so at a time, which can be helpful in warding off obsessive editing. The keyboard is large and comfortable, and you can work for up to twenty-six hours on a few AA batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Baty, Chris (2010-07-01). No Plot? No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days (p. 74). Chronicle Books LLC. Kindle Edition. </p>

<p>“Yes. This is a right thing. This is genius,” I muttered quietly to myself. Here was something that embodied the ideal of “one thing well”. A concept that I’ve always loved, all the more because I’m so terribly bad at sticking to one thing for any length of time. </p>

<p>When I first read this the NEO2 was still a current concern, priced around $200, which was out of my price range, or rather outside of the budget I could concieveably justify on a writing toy. So I shelved the idea of owning one for a while and went on with my life.</p>

<p>And wrote <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a>. And got paid for it, twice now. Not a lot, mind you<sup id="fnref:yet"><a href="#fn:yet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but actual cash money. Which means I have a little money to spend on writing toys. But when I went back to the Alphasmart website I discovered that the Neo’s time had come to a close.</p>

<p>The NEO is no longer being manufactured. The company has shut down that arm of their business, and all that’s left is second-hand models that schools are getting rid of, as near as I can tell. But that’s a blessing for someone like me, because the price on a second-hand model on eBay is usually in the $40-$60 range. After a few hours of looking at all the different models that Alphasmart had ever made, comparing them and learning far more about them than I had previously thought possible I found one at the right price and a deal was struck. </p>

<h2 id="about-the-neo">About the NEO</h2>

<p>The NEO is a device that was designed to fulfill a very specific role: it is for <em>writing</em>. It is not for web surfing, it doesn’t have a browser or even a network interface. It’s not for games, it’s got a very simple display that can show you around six lines of text at a time. It’s not for reading email. It is only for <em>writing</em>. </p>

<p>Being designed for the classroom has other advantages. Alphasmart products are legendarily rugged, built to withstand grade school students long enough to justify the school board’s expenditure on them. They are an instant-on device, because there’s no real OS to load up. Turn it on, write. They are the most energy conscious devices ever: Several owners claim they will run for <em>seven hundred hours</em> on a fresh set of 3 AA batteries. So far I’ve used my device for about 20 hours and I’m at around 98% battery, so that sounds surprisingly accurate. </p>

<p>Granted, the NEO is not a machine with great specs. For starters, it has 512K of RAM, which is charming. My Macbook Pro has roughly 33,000 times that much. But that 512K is enough to hold about 200 pages of text, split out over 8 files. When all you’re doing is writing you don’t need a lot of storage space. Text is small. </p>

<p>Equally charming is the NEO-computer interface: plug the NEO in via USB and the computer will recognize it as a keyboard. So you open Word or Scrivener or your favorite text program on your computer, put the cursor where you want the text and press “send” on the NEO. Suddenly the computer thinks the NEO is a keyboard where someone is typing at around 200 words per minute. </p>

<p>And that is the <em>whole point</em> of the device. It’s focused, so it can do it’s “one thing” well. It’s rugged, so it can go camping. It’s inexpensive, so if it turns out that taking it camping was a bad idea you can replace it without too much heartache. And did I mention that it’s a very <em>focused</em> device? When you are writing on a NEO you can’t be sneaking peeks at your email, or twitter or anything else. All you can do is write. It’s the perfect middle step between a paper notebook and a MacBook.</p>

<p>It also imparts a strange and wonderful sense of detachment from the writing grind. Everything you write disappears off the top of the screen in a matter of moments, leaving you with just your most recent thought and maybe the conclusion of the one before it. More than once I have written for an hour or less, and felt like I got a little bit done, plugged the NEO into my computer and watched as thousands of words pour out across the page. Turns out it’s easier to be productive when you’re not worrying about your productivity. </p>
