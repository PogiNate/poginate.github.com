  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to all the amazing people who bought <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/"><em>Painless Vim</em></a> I‚Äôve got a little bit of spare cash to put into things that make my job easier. I‚Äôve had my eye on one such convenience for quite some time now: a customized mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/full_keyboard.png" title="My beautifully custom keyboard." /></p>

<p>For those of you who aren‚Äôt insane, mechanical keyboards are a <em>big deal</em> these days, amongst people who think too much about their working setup. If you want to know more about why mechanical is the way to go I suggest reading this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-choose-the-best-mechanical-keyboard-and-why-you-511140347">excellent article on Lifehacker</a> that covers it nicely. </p>

<p><em>Anyway</em> when my recent royalty check came in from Leanpub I realized I was finally in the position to fulfill an old dream of mine: buy a fully customized, fully mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>A few years ago I found out about a company called <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD Keyboards</a>, and they are delightfully obsessed with making top of the line keyboards that fit <em>you</em>. Not you, the general purpose programmer, not ‚Äúyou‚Äù the one-size-fits-all gamer,  <strong>you</strong>, individually. If you want your keys to be in alternate rows of white and  yellow they can do that for you. If you want all your keys totally blank, the <code>HJKL</code> keys red and everything else black, that‚Äôs cool, they‚Äôre on it. However you want to do it, <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/gallery">they will do it</a>. You can design your dream keyboard on their website, choosing from several different key layouts, and the ability to specifically color every single key on the board. If the customization on the site isn‚Äôt specific enough you can send them a file with <em>exactly</em> how you want every key printed, and they will do it.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/extra_ctrl.png" title="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" alt="On my keyboard there is no such thing as &#34;Caps Lock&#34;" /></p>

<p>And it gets better. WASD is in the business of keyboards and keyboards only, and they listen to their customers. The <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-104-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html#ad-image-0">V2 models</a> have a series of DIP switches on the bottom that let you customize all the good stuff. Things like ‚ÄúMake <code>Caps Lock</code> into a third <code>Ctrl</code> button‚Äù for us vim fans.<sup id="fnref:notice"><a href="#fn:notice" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  Things like ‚Äúswap the <code>Alt</code> and <code>OS</code> keys‚Äù for us OSX fans. Things like ‚ÄúSwitch to Colemak or Dvorak‚Äù for people who take their typing seriously<sup id="fnref:notyet"><a href="#fn:notyet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. All these switches are handled on the keyboard itself, so you don‚Äôt have to mess around with system settings. </p>

<p>If you are crazy like me and care about the details, I got this keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches, which have a nice tactile bump halfway down, at the actuation point. If you understood that sentence, welcome to the club of people who should sleep more and study keyboards less. Pull up a chair. If you didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs nerd speak for saying ‚ÄúI can push the keys halfway down and they register, which is easier on your fingers, and when they register there‚Äôs a little bump you can feel letting you know the key registered.‚Äù</p>

<p>The build quality is quite high<sup id="fnref:CODEKeyboard"><a href="#fn:CODEKeyboard" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> from what I‚Äôve seen so far, with a nice weight to the keyboard, excellent motion on every single key, and sharp, laser-etched inscriptions on every keycap. </p>

<p>I guess if there is a point to this post it‚Äôs twofold: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Thank you, All of you, who have supported me in my writing.</li>
  <li>If you‚Äôre looking at getting a mechanical keyboard you should seriously consider WASD Keyboards. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. </li>
</ol>

<p>And now, back to work on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux/"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a> üòÉ</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I‚Äôve been working on <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_tmux">Painless Tmux</a> and trying to apply a lot of what I learned while writing <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a> to make the process easier and more streamlined. </p>

<p>And one of the problems that I‚Äôve been beating my head against is this:</p>

<p>Tables. </p>

<p>Tables in Markdown are a mess. Understandably so, because you‚Äôre trying to keep everything nicely lined up in plain text, which just doesn‚Äôt happen. Compound that with proportional fonts in Scrivener and you have something that nobody should ever have to look at. There‚Äôs a couple of problems here, of course. </p>

<p>The first is that it‚Äôs easy for bugs to hide in messy code<sup id="fnref:orText"><a href="#fn:orText" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I‚Äôve had to run my manuscript files through Leanpub‚Äôs markdown generator multiple times before I got my tables right. </p>

<p>So: step one: after putting all the data in a table let‚Äôs get the table all lined up and looking nice. This is where vim steps in. Specifically, vim with the <a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a> plugin. </p>

<p>Using Tabular I can turn a table that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |  
|  ------ | ------ |  
| some text | A second bit o' text |   
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text	| 
</code></pre>

<p>into this:</p>

<pre><code>| Heading 1                                        | Heading 2            |
| ------                                           | ------               |
| some text                                        | A second bit o' text |
| Still more text, this time of a different length | small text           |
</code></pre>

<p>all by typing <code>:Tab /|</code> in vim<sup id="fnref:learnMore"><a href="#fn:learnMore" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So far so good. But when I paste this back into Scrivener it looks terrible again, because Scrivener uses proportional fonts<sup id="fnref:myScriv"><a href="#fn:myScriv" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kerned-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with proportional text" /></p>

<p>This was an even easier problem to solve, I just didn‚Äôt realize it it until today. Scrivener lets you use all kinds of rich text features while writing, all of which it ignores when exporting or compiling your text for output. This means, of course, that I can style my tables with a monospaced font and suddenly they line up the way they were supposed to all along. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/monospaced-scriv.png" title="Scrivener with Monospaced text" /></p>

<p>But changing the fonts manually every time I make a table is a drag. Enter the ‚Äúpresets‚Äù feature that Scrivener uses. Its basically the Apple ‚ÄúStyles‚Äù menu, but enhanced and made more Scrivener-like. All I had to do was highlight the monospaced section, then in the menu go to <code>Format-&gt;Formatting-&gt;New Preset From Selection</code> and now I can make any of my text nicely monospaced with the click of a button. And while I was at it I re-styled the ‚ÄúBody‚Äù preset to be the the way I (currently) like it. </p>

<p>So there you have it: a couple of simple, common sense tips for making tables less of a nightmare in your Markdown manuscripts. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/pt_cover_web.png" title="Painless Tmux Cover" /></p>

<p>For about the last year I&rsquo;ve been working on <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim"><em>Painless Vim</em></a>, and really enjoying it. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about writing, and of course I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about vim. But for the last little while it&rsquo;s been slowing down. I&rsquo;ve written all the text, and I&rsquo;ve been through a few rounds of revisions, both from changes made by editors and from changes suggested by readers. And now it&rsquo;s pretty much done. Sure, there are a few revisions left to make, but they&rsquo;re nothing compared to the work I&rsquo;ve been putting into it over the previous months. </p>

<p>So I decided to write <em>another</em> book. You see, I realized that, while I use vim for basically all my programming work, that&rsquo;s only half the story. Vim is great, but there&rsquo;s no real reason to use a terminal based text editor if that&rsquo;s <em>all</em> you&rsquo;re doing from the terminal. And for the past year or more, while I&rsquo;ve been learning and writing about vim, I&rsquo;ve also been using <strong>tmux</strong> to get more out of my terminal, and to compliment and augment vim&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m writing a book to compliment and augment <em>Painless Vim</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux"><em>Painless Tmux</em></a> is brand new, and as I write this it&rsquo;s only 15 pages long. There&rsquo;s a lot of life ahead of it, and I&rsquo;m really excited about this one. For one thing, tmux is <em>so much easier</em> to use and to learn than vim. Especially if you&rsquo;re already using vim. </p>

<p>Together, vim and tmux let you do pretty much everything, all from the keyboard. so, I&rsquo;m also offering the <a href="https://leanpub.com/b/painless_productivity">two books as a bundle</a>, for significantly less than buying them separately. Basically if you buy the bundle you get <em>Painless Tmux</em> for a dollar. </p>

<p>When I started <em>Painless Vim</em> I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was getting myself into. I figured it would take a month, tops. Well, this time, I <em>do</em> know what I&rsquo;m getting myself into and I&rsquo;m excited to get into it. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/Chicago-Avenue-Moon_web.png" title="Chicago Avenue Moon Icon" />
Heading out, leaving work. It‚Äôs about two miles home, an easy half-hour walk. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs all downhill. I decide to let Chicago Avenue Moon do its thing while I walk. Let‚Äôs hear some procedurally generated tunes. </p>

<p>The UI doesn‚Äôt tell me much; or rather, it <em>does</em>, but not in a way that I can understand. A string of numbers running down one side of the screen slowly starts filling in, going from all <code>0.00</code> to‚Ä¶other numbers. Probably based on my walking speed? A line swings across four circles, highlighting them‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs it. But it‚Äôs time to put the device away, time to walk. </p>

<p>The sound starts slowly‚Ä¶a quiet susurrous of static is all for a moment, then a gentle swell of strings, maybe?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/CAM-Screen.png" title="Screenshot from Chicago Avenue Moon" />
Slowly the sonic landscape fills in: quiet, layered sounds give way to rising waves of music. It‚Äôs like having an audio-only link to some other world. This isn‚Äôt music I‚Äôve heard a thousand times before, this is something new and unique, being created by my walk, and it opens my eyes. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen everything along this route hundreds of times, but I‚Äôm seeing it more clearly this time. Bright, living green grasses under a mottled gray cloudy sky. I‚Äôm more aware of colors than I‚Äôve been in a long time, I‚Äôm open to the feeling of the wind‚Ä¶and presently the rain.</p>

<p>I pull my umbrella out of my messenger bag and pop it open, imagining what I might look like from above. A drab, office-worker colored stalk, watered by the rain, suddenly bursts into a bright red and white flower fighting the wind. </p>

<p>The sounds of wind and rain fold themselves into the music from Chicago Avenue, and in my quiet and dreamlike state it‚Äôs easy to believe that whatever mathematical equations are controlling the sounds are also orchestrating the storm, for as soon as I turn a corner the rain slows, then stops. The music, too, changes gradually, adapting to my new position and heading. The whoosh and hiss of cars driving past in the rain‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all one.</p>

<p>At length I turn the corner onto my street, and one by one the layers of music fall away, leaving only a slow, stately tone, rolling in grand waves, and fading slightly, a fitting end to a walk in another world. </p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/chicago-avenue-moon.html"> <em>Chicago Avenue Moon</em> </a> is an oddity on the App Store. Created by <a href="http://junecloud.com">JuneCloud</a>, who are best known for their <a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/delivery-status-touch.html"> package tracking app </a>, it‚Äôs a pure work of art, and one that succeeds. According to the website, it was originally the vision of <a href="http://quieterrors.com/">Joshua Dumas</a>, a musician who wanted to </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶help re-enchant a person‚Äôs daily commute, trip to the laundromat, or evening jog. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A worthy goal. </p>

<p>The app really does create a soundscape that is throbbing with life, full of strange, alien combinations, and occasionally overlaid with bursts of static, as if you really were channeling this music from somewhere far away.</p>

<p>It may not be the perfect soundtrack for every single day, but if you want to include a little bit of mystery into your daily wanderings it‚Äôs definitely worth a try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/NEO.jpg" width="400" height="400" title="The Alphasmart Neo in its natural habitat" />
A thing I once thought would never happen has happened twice: I have been paid for something I wrote by people who actually ponied up their own hard-earned cash to buy <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">a thing I wrote</a>. I can‚Äôt even tell you how awesome that is. If you are one of those people I thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>

<p>But that‚Äôs not what this article is about. This article is about what I did with the second royalty check I got from Leanpub a few days ago:</p>

<p>I bought an Alphasmart NEO. </p>

<p>I first became aware of the existence of these little wonders when I was reading Chris Baty‚Äôs<sup id="fnref:whoIsChris"><a href="#fn:whoIsChris" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> book ‚ÄúNo Plot? No Problem!‚Äù. Says he:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some NaNoWriMo participants swear by an affordable machine called an Alphasmart (www.alphasmart.com). This is a battery-powered, word-processing device that looks like a cross between a laptop and a children‚Äôs Speak &amp; Spell. The miniscule screen only displays four lines of text or so at a time, which can be helpful in warding off obsessive editing. The keyboard is large and comfortable, and you can work for up to twenty-six hours on a few AA batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Äì Baty, Chris (2010-07-01). No Plot? No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days (p. 74). Chronicle Books LLC. Kindle Edition. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes. This is a right thing. This is genius,‚Äù I muttered quietly to myself. Here was something that embodied the ideal of ‚Äúone thing well‚Äù. A concept that I‚Äôve always loved, all the more because I‚Äôm so terribly bad at sticking to one thing for any length of time. </p>

<p>When I first read this the NEO2 was still a current concern, priced around $200, which was out of my price range, or rather outside of the budget I could concieveably justify on a writing toy. So I shelved the idea of owning one for a while and went on with my life.</p>

<p>And wrote <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a>. And got paid for it, twice now. Not a lot, mind you<sup id="fnref:yet"><a href="#fn:yet" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but actual cash money. Which means I have a little money to spend on writing toys. But when I went back to the Alphasmart website I discovered that the Neo‚Äôs time had come to a close.</p>

<p>The NEO is no longer being manufactured. The company has shut down that arm of their business, and all that‚Äôs left is second-hand models that schools are getting rid of, as near as I can tell. But that‚Äôs a blessing for someone like me, because the price on a second-hand model on eBay is usually in the $40-$60 range. After a few hours of looking at all the different models that Alphasmart had ever made, comparing them and learning far more about them than I had previously thought possible I found one at the right price and a deal was struck. </p>

<h2 id="about-the-neo">About the NEO</h2>

<p>The NEO is a device that was designed to fulfill a very specific role: it is for <em>writing</em>. It is not for web surfing, it doesn‚Äôt have a browser or even a network interface. It‚Äôs not for games, it‚Äôs got a very simple display that can show you around six lines of text at a time. It‚Äôs not for reading email. It is only for <em>writing</em>. </p>

<p>Being designed for the classroom has other advantages. Alphasmart products are legendarily rugged, built to withstand grade school students long enough to justify the school board‚Äôs expenditure on them. They are an instant-on device, because there‚Äôs no real OS to load up. Turn it on, write. They are the most energy conscious devices ever: Several owners claim they will run for <em>seven hundred hours</em> on a fresh set of 3 AA batteries. So far I‚Äôve used my device for about 20 hours and I‚Äôm at around 98% battery, so that sounds surprisingly accurate. </p>

<p>Granted, the NEO is not a machine with great specs. For starters, it has 512K of RAM, which is charming. My Macbook Pro has roughly 33,000 times that much. But that 512K is enough to hold about 200 pages of text, split out over 8 files. When all you‚Äôre doing is writing you don‚Äôt need a lot of storage space. Text is small. </p>

<p>Equally charming is the NEO-computer interface: plug the NEO in via USB and the computer will recognize it as a keyboard. So you open Word or Scrivener or your favorite text program on your computer, put the cursor where you want the text and press ‚Äúsend‚Äù on the NEO. Suddenly the computer thinks the NEO is a keyboard where someone is typing at around 200 words per minute. </p>

<p>And that is the <em>whole point</em> of the device. It‚Äôs focused, so it can do it‚Äôs ‚Äúone thing‚Äù well. It‚Äôs rugged, so it can go camping. It‚Äôs inexpensive, so if it turns out that taking it camping was a bad idea you can replace it without too much heartache. And did I mention that it‚Äôs a very <em>focused</em> device? When you are writing on a NEO you can‚Äôt be sneaking peeks at your email, or twitter or anything else. All you can do is write. It‚Äôs the perfect middle step between a paper notebook and a MacBook.</p>

<p>It also imparts a strange and wonderful sense of detachment from the writing grind. Everything you write disappears off the top of the screen in a matter of moments, leaving you with just your most recent thought and maybe the conclusion of the one before it. More than once I have written for an hour or less, and felt like I got a little bit done, plugged the NEO into my computer and watched as thousands of words pour out across the page. Turns out it‚Äôs easier to be productive when you‚Äôre not worrying about your productivity. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>‚Ä¶yet. </p>

<p>Last Saturday I opened an account. The next day I closed it.</p>

<p>On the surface <a href="https://www.oysterbooks.com/">Oyster Books</a> looks like a great thing: pay $10 every month and get access to a growing library of books. This, you would think, is basically playing right to my wheelhouse. I love books, I love reading, and I love eBooks on my mobile devices. </p>

<p>But it‚Äôs not for me. Why is that?</p>

<p>I mean, $9.95 isn‚Äôt bad; it‚Äôs kinda-sorta the same price as Netflix, and I read far more than I watch in a given month. I could easily read four or five books every month and it would probably be a good thing, right?</p>

<p>Except‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Except what <em>kind</em> of books are on the service? I have a hard enough time finding books I consider ‚Äúworth reading‚Äù on iBooks or Kindle. Anything that is older than the digital age and not √ºber mainstream tends to get forgotten. Anything that has slipped into the public domain is spammed out on the store, thousands of copies, most of them terrible OCR transfers that were never read or reviewed before being shoved onto the store to make a few bucks. </p>

<p>And from what I‚Äôve seen Oyster hasn‚Äôt really drawn a different crowd. They have a number of recent best sellers, but a much shallower back bench than the other services, once you remove the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenburg</a> rips that everyone has. Oyster has a single Bill Bryson book, the other services have most of his catalog. I could keep going, but the odds are my numbers will all be wrong in a day or two. The <em>point</em> is that I spent a few hours searching Oyster‚Äôs catalog for things I really <em>wanted</em> to read and came up with a single book.</p>

<p>But ‚Äúworth reading‚Äù can be a dangerous phrase, and it‚Äôs one that doesn‚Äôt really sound like <em>me</em> to me. I have spent my life reading just about everything I come across. I‚Äôm an author myself, and I should therefore want to stoke the fires of my own literary career by pulling in the best of everyone else‚Äôs, right?</p>

<p>Well, yeah. But my time is limited. I work eight hours a day and spend six hours trying to build and maintain a relationship with my wife and kiddos. I squeeze in exercise, games and writing around the edges of this by sleeping between five and seven hours a night. So if I‚Äôm going to read a book it needs to be worth the precious minutes I give it. And here‚Äôs where a lesson I learned years ago comes back into play.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager I got hired by Bookstar, a small bookstore that was a subsidiary of Barnes and Noble. Shortly after I started at Bookstar we moved into a full-fledged Barnes and Noble superstore. It was a flagship store for the region, and was bigger than any two libraries I had ever visited in my young life. During the early days I would walk through the store in sheer wonder, feeling the immensity of the world‚Äôs wisdom, collected around me. I was in heaven. I was surrounded by all that was best and brightest in the world of words.</p>

<p>Except‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt. The world‚Äôs greatest books <em>were</em> in there; we had the entire Loeb Classical Library, both Greek and Latin; the works of Proust and cummings Chesterton and Wodehouse and Feynman and Hawking and Picasso and Miles Davis (in our music department, of course) and the upcoming geniuses as well. But they were thin on the ground compared to the romance novels, serial mysteries, spin-off sci-fi, brainless self-help books<sup id="fnref:disclaimer"><a href="#fn:disclaimer" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>‚Ä¶all the books that look very impressive until you realize that they weren‚Äôt written to increase the sum total of human knowledge, they were written to increase the publisher‚Äôs bottom line. For every masterpiece that was turned out because the author had a story that <em>must be told</em> there were thirty books that were trying to capitalize on the latest blockbuster. </p>

<p>And I read them. As an employee I was allowed to check books out from the shelves with the understanding that if I bent it I bought it<sup id="fnref:noBend"><a href="#fn:noBend" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I picked things up joyfully from just about every shelf and read and read and read‚Ä¶and realized that a lot of what I read wasn‚Äôt making my life better. I wasn‚Äôt any happier, I wasn‚Äôt any smarter or any more connected to my fellow human beings. I was just‚Ä¶older. But reading is addictive; even if you‚Äôre not in love with the book you‚Äôre reading you can still enjoy the experience. So I kept just reading anything, working my way through series after series of 300-page fantasy titles that had all the intelligence of a sitcom, but slower, or through 1,100 page epics that were anything but.</p>

<p>Finally I told myself that my time was worth more, and I needed to read things that were ‚Äúworth reading‚Äù. I got myself a list of ‚Äúgreat books‚Äù and started into it. Some resonated with me, some didn‚Äôt. Some were amazing and some had aged poorly enough that I couldn‚Äôt really follow them and lost interest. I still picked up light fantasy titles now and again, but I was determined to change.</p>

<p>So now I generally only read things that I feel have a real point or enough artistry to be worth the time. I say generally, but it‚Äôs easy to relapse. I fully recognize that some of my favorite books in recent years are entirely devoid of anything resembling substance or style. And that‚Äôs where I get back around to why I probably shouldn‚Äôt sign (back) up for Oyster, at least not yet:</p>

<p>I would start reading crap again. </p>

<p>If I was paying ten bucks for a service I would make sure I was getting ‚Äúmy money‚Äôs worth‚Äù out of the service by ploughing through at least two or three books each month. And I would <em>love</em> it. But I don‚Äôt think it would be good for me. </p>

<p>Instead, I‚Äôll just set aside $10 a month for new books. Buying one every a month is about right, and gives me time to catch up on my huge library at home. </p>

<time datetime="2014-01-13T11:15:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 13<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/vp_icon.png" title="VoodooPad Icon" alt="The VoodooPad Icon" />
I‚Äôve <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">mentioned before</a> that I go through three phases as I get used to a new program: <em>Inquiry</em>, <em>Inquisition</em> and <em>Investment</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Inquiry</em> phase is the ‚Äúdoes it do what I want it to do, without being irritating?‚Äù phase. Basically this is like a caveman poking a thing with a sharp stick, hiding behind a rock to see if it tries to bite him, then biting <em>it</em> to see if it‚Äôs worth eating.</p>

  <p>If a program gets past that, then comes the <em>Inquisition</em>: ‚ÄúOh yeah, well can you handle <em>this</em>? What about <em>that</em>? And how do you like the <em>comfy chair</em>?‚Äù</p>

  <p>Anything that makes it past the Inquisition with any level of approval gets my <em>Investment</em>, the phase where I put the time into learning how to use the program to its fullest and really start using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve put VoodooPad through the wringer before. Searching through my email reveals that I have a version 2 license<sup id="fnref:password"><a href="#fn:password" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I liked the idea, the core of VoodooPad back then, but it never got past the Inquisition. I could see that it <em>wanted</em> to do things right, but we never <em>clicked</em>. </p>

<p>Still, when I got the email that VoodooPad had left its original home at Flying Meat I was kinda saddened. It may not have been my cup of tea, but it was still an amazing product and it‚Äôs cool in a way that is hard to put into words. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think Gus of Flying Meat made the right choice when he decided to <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2013/11/a_new_home_for_voodoopad.html">sell VoodooPad</a>. If he doesn‚Äôt feel he can maintain it any more nobody would know better than he would. </p>

<p>The new owners at <a href="https://plausible.coop/">Plausible Labs</a> have promised to make it better and take great care of it, because they love VoodooPad and want to see it grow. That‚Äôs great news. </p>

<p>But can I trust it?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs two questions there: Can I trust Plausible Labs to keep making VoodooPad better, and can I trust VoodooPad to be good enough to deserve my investment?</p>

<p>For the record I‚Äôve already purchased my license; so we‚Äôre not talking about <em>financial</em> investment. I‚Äôm talking about investing my time, which is far more valuable these days. (‚Äúoh, look at Mr. Moneybags!‚Äù Yeah, yeah, you know what I meant.)</p>

<p>So, second question first: Can I trust VoodooPad, the program, to be what I want it to be?</p>

<h2 id="trusting-the-program">Trusting the Program</h2>

<p>This is the bigger of the two questions. After all, if VoodooPad is good enough to use and invest in now it doesn‚Äôt need a lot of updates all the time. My beloved Scrivener gets (I would say) <em>Just enough</em> updates: Not every month, but every so often. And even if updates stopped tomorrow I would keep using it until it no longer worked on whatever Mac I was using in the far future. </p>

<p>So I‚Äôve started the process. I would say I‚Äôm near the end of the Inquisition phase right now. And what I‚Äôve found is hopeful. Coming to version 5 of VoodooPad from version 2 left me refreshingly free of preconceived notions about the program: I knew it was a ‚ÄúPersonal Wiki‚Äù and that‚Äôs about it. </p>

<p>Markdown support has entered the mix since last I checked the app, and even better, it seems to fully understand MultiMarkdown<sup id="fnref:mmd"><a href="#fn:mmd" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is a huge win. Simple Markdown like headings, strong, italic, etc. are all handled correctly and shown while you‚Äôre editing the text. </p>

<p>The other <em>sine qua non</em> for a personal wiki that I had is inter-page links that just <em>appear</em> without any additional markup/markdown/whatever. When I type the name of another page I want it to be clickable. VoodooPad does that with aplomb. </p>

<p>So, as a personal wiki it‚Äôs doing what I want it to do. <em>Check</em>. </p>

<p>And there‚Äôs a lot more that I haven‚Äôt fully explored yet<sup id="fnref:investment"><a href="#fn:investment" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, like in-app scripting in Python, JSTalk, Ruby, shell, etc. and other potentially useful things like tagging, collections, built-in todo list collection‚Ä¶it‚Äôs basically the kitchen sink. </p>

<p>But there‚Äôs one huge dark spot: the iOS version of the app. It‚Äôs definitely been lacking in love or attention for years now. It‚Äôs not iOS 7-compiled, and most of the UI looks more like iOS 4. It doesn‚Äôt seem to open my main document, and it has separate editing/reading modes, thus getting rid of the main good thing I see in the desktop version. But, again, Plausible promises that improvments are coming. Which leads us to the second point: Trusting the company.</p>

<h2 id="trusting-plausible-labs">Trusting Plausible Labs</h2>

<p>This is where I have a bigger problem. It‚Äôs not that I think they‚Äôre incompetent, or lazy, or bad developers or anything. Just as I believe Gus knew when to get out of VoodooPad, I also believe that he didn‚Äôt hand it over to someone who would mess it up. But it‚Äôs not their baby. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm not saying I think they‚Äôll let it languish, but they need to know that now is a very sensitive period for the product. They shouldn‚Äôt rush any bug fixes or new features just for the sake of putting out a new version, but semi-regular updates on the blog about how the work is coming, some notification that they <em>are</em> working on it would go a long way to build confidence.<sup id="fnref:clockwork"><a href="#fn:clockwork" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>That said, I‚Äôm going to <em>Invest</em>-with-a-capital-I in VoodooPad. And I great hopes of seeing Plausible Labs do great things with it. I just hope we don‚Äôt have to wait too long. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 1998 I served an <a href="http://mormon.org/values/missionary-work">LDS Mission</a> to the Philippines. Those of you who are familiar with how LDS missionaries operate know the drill: you spend ten weeks learning the language in a classroom setting and then you get sent out with a more experienced missionary to try it on your own. And anyone who has ever tried to speak a language they‚Äôve only heard in a classroom setting knows what comes next: you spend a lot of time staring at people who speak a language you thought you were pretty good at, and you have no idea what they‚Äôre saying. </p>

<p>So I set myself some goals. I wanted to laugh at a Tagalog joke, because I actually understood it. I wanted to get my accent to be less terrible<sup id="fnref:accent"><a href="#fn:accent" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I wanted to actually think in Tagalog. These were little stepping stones I set for myself, goals I was trying to reach to show that I was actually gaining some actual fluency in the language. </p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="&#8220;Kaya ko ito!&#8221;">
And then, one night a few months after I landed in Manila I had a thought, just three words that came to me as I was walking across the town square: ‚ÄúKaya ko ito!‚Äù That was it. In English<sup id="fnref:sorta"><a href="#fn:sorta" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI can do this‚Äù.  But that‚Äôs not the point. The point was that I had the thought <em>in Tagalog</em> instead of having it in English and translating it. I had a long way to go, but it was clear that something was happening, and I was learning something. Since then that thought has come back to me from time to time when I‚Äôm trying to do something difficult. I‚Äôll start in one something, bang my head against the wall for a while, and all of a sudden there will be a moment of clarity, a brief glimpse of the summit after the first day‚Äôs climb, and the words ‚ÄúKaya ko ito‚Äù will come back into my head. I can do this.
</span></p>

<p>One of those difficult things has been learning vim. While I‚Äôve been teaching myself to use it<sup id="fnref:painlessplug"><a href="#fn:painlessplug" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I‚Äôve had a lot of moments where it just seemed too hard, too useless, and I had to set myself some goals. They were simpler goals, things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lose half a file and have to restore it from my git backups again today‚Äù, and then more useful goals, like ‚Äúactually use the search and replace engine,‚Äù followed shortly by ‚Äúactually use vim‚Äôs regex engine without the <code>very magic</code> flag‚Äù. Litte steps to show that I was making progress. </p>

<p>And one day, just a little while ago, I had a simple task ahead of me: remove the last three arguments from a function declaration. Without really thinking about it I got my cursor inside the parentheses and since my cursor was just before the closing paren I typed</p>

<pre><code>d3F,
</code></pre>

<p>And that was it. In English<sup id="fnref:kinda"><a href="#fn:kinda" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> it‚Äôs ‚Äúdelete back through the third comma before the cursor‚Äù. But that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that I just <em>did</em> it, without looking at a cheat sheet, without using help, without standing there for two minutes trying to figure out how to do what I knew I wanted to do. It was the ‚ÄúKaya kong ito‚Äù moment all over again. I know I‚Äôve still got a lot of vim to learn, but it‚Äôs clear that something is happening, and I‚Äôm learning something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year marks my sixth year participating in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, and I‚Äôve started wondering if there was really a <em>point</em> to writing a ‚Äúnovel‚Äù in a single month. Especially since I haven‚Äôt really developed any of them beyond the rough draft I wrote in November. </p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/nano_win.png" title="National Novel Writing Month Winner" alt="National Novel Writing Month Winner" /> So, I ‚Äúwon‚Äù again this year, writing a book that I have absolutely no desire to pursue further. Which has made me wonder if I‚Äôm doing it wrong or if I need to maybe just give up on NaNoWriMo because it‚Äôs not helping me grow as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù writer. But then I realized something.</p>

<p>I never would have written <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em> if I hadn‚Äôt been taking part of NaNoWriMo every year. <em>Painless Vim</em> isn‚Äôt a novel, it‚Äôs not a wild flight of fancy that I pounded out in a month.<sup id="fnref:supposed"><a href="#fn:supposed" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  But there are a lot of things I learned from NaNoWriMo that made it possible for me to write <em>Painless Vim</em>. Some of the most important are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Write every day. This is the first and only secret of writing, of course. </li>
  <li>Write your first draft like nobody is going to read it, because nobody <em>is</em> going to read it. You‚Äôll revise it into something better. </li>
  <li>Write for yourself. There are others out there who are in the same place as you, and they‚Äôll appreciate what you‚Äôve written. </li>
  <li>Use Scrivener. <a href="http://www.favoritethingever.com/2010/10/scrivener/">I absolutely <em>love</em> Scrivener</a>, and six years of NaNo‚Äôing has made it as comfortable as a well-worn pair of blue jeans for me. If I get up the energy I‚Äôll write a post about how my Scrivener workflow looks one of these days. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs best author. But I wrote a book and put it out there where people can buy it, which is something that never would have happened if it hadn‚Äôt been for National Novel Writing Month. And that‚Äôs enough to keep me coming back year after year.</p>

<p>The roadway sparkles and flows with light, a jeweled strand across the dark landscape. Cylee sat far up on a hill, the fresh, wild wind blowing her hair back. </p>

<p>She used to live in this place, this quiet, dark, outdoor world. Back before Pacifica, before the war‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The strings of lights eventually merge into the cities, connecting the nets of lights that represent civilization, mankind‚Äôs crowning jewels shining in the dark. And once you‚Äôre caught in that net it can feel like there‚Äôs nothing else, no other way to live. You can learn to depend on the Network, constant wireless streams of information flowing into and out of you at all times. You can learn to read the streets as you read the trees, feel the way the social wind is blowing just as you used to know how to read the fitful pre-dawn breezes. </p>

<p>And, in truth, Cylee was caught by that net. If she stayed out here for a few days or weeks her Spine would shut down and go from being an Augmentation to being thirty pounds of stiff dead metal. She‚Äôd be essentially blinded and deafened, her limbs left to their own strength. Even now she was half blind, her Spine out of range of the Network and therefore unable to give her the kind of information that made up the background noise of her daily life. Granted, she could still see every living, warm blooded thing that moved in the darkness, every rabbit, every bat, every bird was a blip on her augmented vision, their insane heart rates pounding like miniature thunder in her ears. </p>

<p>But she used to track them unaided. Used to be able to sense the movement of creatures that were string to remain hidden. She could feel the twitch in the grass that didn‚Äôt <em>quite</em> match the way the wind was moving. And she would raise her bow quietly, wait for the next movement‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶with a soft twang she would have breakfast.</p>

<p>Out of a sense of irony and frustration she considered raising her flechette thrower and pinning that rabbit to the ground, letting her Spine handle the fine details of getting her hand in the right position, but she stopped, realized she didn‚Äôt need the meat, and shouldn‚Äôt waste it. Pacifica had made her a perfect soldier, but it hadn‚Äôt entirely removed the true hunter she had been. </p>
