  <div class="entry-content"><p>There’s a saying about marriage that you should find a spouse with your eyes wide open and stay with a spouse with your eyes half shut.<sup id="fnref:source"><a href="#fn:source" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve found this to be helpful advice about more than just marriage; when I buy a new computer I spend months reading reviews and write ups on the all the components involved and scouring the world for the best prices. Once I buy my components I all but block those sites on my browser; I don’t <em>want</em> to know that a brand new video card came out the same day my suddenly obsolete one arrives at my door. I just want to be happy with what I bought.</p>

<p>And, in an odd way it’s turning out to be true about writing <em><a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>. There are two books and a few websites that I used quite a bit while I was starting to learn vim, they are somehow on my “okay” list. But any site or book I haven’t read yet is now <em>the enemy</em>, because I’m afraid they’re all better than the book I’m writing and I’ll have to die now. There are (at least) <a href="https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro">two</a> <a href="https://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway">other</a> vim books already on Leanpub.com; I can’t look at them too directly lest I discover the only thing my book has that the don’t is a whimsical cover. </p>

<p>And, of course, what does it matter? If other books are better that’s fine; I can hope that there are some people out there who will get what they need out of my little book. So I’m keeping my head in the sand a little bit. Some day I’ll be done writing <em>Painless Vim</em> and I’ll be able to read other people’s vim books.</p>

<p>There’s no real point here; just a little note about how my mind seems to work when I’m mid-book like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/pacifica_cover.jpg" width="250" title="Pacifica Cover" />
This is a super-short post to show off what I&rsquo;m going to be working on for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> this year. </p>

<p>I know that <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim/">Painless Vim</a></em> isn&rsquo;t finished yet, although it&rsquo;s very close, and basically all I&rsquo;m doing is a little bit of cleanup and formatting. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting with baited breath for <em>Painless Vim</em> to be finished fear not! I will still be working on the Little Vim Book that Could during the month of November. In fact, my goal is to have it completely finished. By December 1st, even while I&rsquo;m &ldquo;winning&rdquo; NaNoWriMo for the sixth straight year. </p>

<p>In previous years I&rsquo;ve been doing graduate level classes, having babies<sup id="fnref:babies"><a href="#fn:babies" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and changing jobs during NaNoWriMo, and I&rsquo;ve always found time to make it work. What&rsquo;s more, the impetus it gives me tends to help me get more done in the rest of my life as well. The saying about giving work to busy people still holds true. If I turn myself into a busy person I tend to be more capable overall. Until I freak out and melt down, of course. So I guess there&rsquo;s still something to be said for balance. </p>

<h2 id="more-about-pacifica">More About Pacifica</h2>

<p>Which is all very nice, but you may possibly be interested in the book cover I&rsquo;m showing off here. You&rsquo;ve got questions, no doubt. Questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who designed your cover?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you be willing to let me redesign your cover, because it&rsquo;s pretty bad?&rdquo; </p>

<p>The answers are &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute&rdquo;, &ldquo;I did in about two hours using Pixelmator&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in that order. I like playing with Pixelmator, but I&rsquo;m not super great with it, and if there&rsquo;s a graphic designer out there who wants to take a second pass at this I&rsquo;d be happy to let you. </p>

<p>The book is my first foray into cyberpunk. It&rsquo;s a near-future look at what&rsquo;s its like to be on the losing side of a war for independence, and how to keep your pride even when you&rsquo;ve got nothing left to be proud of. </p>

<p>If I remember (and have time) I&rsquo;ll probably post excerpts through the month. Wether or not I actually develop <em>Pacifica</em> after November remains to be seen, but if I&rsquo;ve learned anything from five successful NaNo&rsquo;s its that even writing an ultimately wasted story isn&rsquo;t wasted effort. I&rsquo;ve learned something from every book I&rsquo;ve written.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/nvALT.png" title="nvALT icon" />
One of the best things about <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> is that it gives you a lot of tools you can use with little to no friction. You can use tags, or not, you can store your files in dropbox as individual markdown files, or you can keep them all in a single database<sup id="fnref:database"><a href="#fn:database" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s all up to you. It&rsquo;s very liberal about how you use its powers.</p>

<p>Which means I missed one.</p>

<p>Up until now I&rsquo;ve been using nvALT as my repository of code and notes on projects, useful tips and hints and things that I tend to forget. You know, all the stuff that makes nvALT great. The praises of nvALT have already been sung, and sung better than I will sing them here. But here&rsquo;s what I just discovered: the inter-note linking feature. </p>

<p><strong>OH. MAN.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, those of you who already knew about this can just go ahead and laugh at me. But for those of you who haven&rsquo;t discovered this yet, it&rsquo;s very very simple and powerful. Just wrap the name of another note in <code>[[double brackets]]</code> and you have a link to that note. What&rsquo;s more, once you open the double brackets you can start typing the name of a file and nvALT will autocomplete it for you.</p>

<p>With this addition, nvALT has supplanted VoodooPad, EverNote, and my <a href="https://github.com/PogiNate/SublimeWiki">own home-brew Sublime Text Wiki system</a>. Not only is it more flexible, but it also has one of the best built-in markdown previews ever. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/SW2-icon.jpg" title="&#34;Small World 2 App Icon&#34;" alt="&#34;Small World 2 App Icon&#34;" />
Just a quick post to happily note that <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com">Days of Wonder</a> has finally updated their <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/small-world-for-ipad/id364165557?mt=8">Small World app</a> on the iPad. Small World was the first game I bought on the original iPad, and it&rsquo;s been sadly neglected for a quite a while. </p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s back in business now! It&rsquo;s beautifully, fully retina, has new content (available through an in app purchase), and now lets you play with up to five people via pass &amp; play, or you can have the one on one experience that you&rsquo;re used to from the original version. I&rsquo;ve always loved Days Of Wonder&rsquo;s games, and they continue to do a great job bringing them to the iPad. Thanks guys!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife and I love board games. So it’s only natural that our kids will love them as well. And that’s <em>awesome</em>. But since all of our kids are under nine years old playing games with them can be a bit of a headache, because they don’t really have a sense of how losing one tiny little piece can ruin a sixty dollar game, and pieces are really small and easily lost. </p>

<p>Enter the iPad. I bought the tablet version of SmallWorld back when I had a 1st Gen iPad, and while it’s fun, at the time my wife and I only used it to pass time when we were waiting for a table at a restauraunt or whatever. Since then I have also picked up Ticket to Ride and Forbidden Island, and my kids and I spent most of this weekend playing all three games over and over and <em>over</em> again, as kids are wont to do. </p>

<p>And it was a pretty amazing experience. I still love my “real” board games, for a number of reasons: the artwork is bigger, you get a tactile sense of what you’re doing, the experience is more immersive, and you can see the board from more than two feet away, etc. etc. </p>

<p>But when you’re playing with a passel of excitable kiddos there’s a lot to be said for keeping the iPad firmly in my hands as they all take their turns, get excited by the (usually quite minimal) resulting animations, and go dance around the room for a while. When the game is over I just close the cover and the game is packed up, no cleanup required. </p>

<p>A quick note about animations: If you’re doing a straight up port of your board game don’t try to make it a full-on video game. Take a look at <em>Ticket to Ride</em> by Days of Wonder and stick to that level: make your graphics and chrome beautiful, but let’s keep it a board game.</p>

<p>The other advantage is price. Since all I’m getting is a pile o’ bytes I don’t have to pay for a bunch of die cut custom printed cardboard pieces, which usually translates into around a 75% savings or better. The companies usually have a lot of high-quality assets all ready for the games, since you can and should use the same art for the digital and analog versions, so the R&amp;D costs are apparently low enough to make it worth doing. </p>

<p>Of course, in my situation this generally means I’m buying a game 1.25 times instead of 2 times, but hey, it’s still a savings. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Edward Snowden basically only verified what we had all already feared: The government is getting information about all of us behind our backs. The problem is that all this time Google has been promising that they’re doing a nice, open, transparent operation, letting us all know what they’re being asked for and what they’re actually giving, and now…well, I have a hard time believing them. </p>

<p>But it’s more than that. The old wisdom about eggs and numbers of baskets used to store them rings very true these days. Regardless of government requests<sup id="fnref:no_hide"><a href="#fn:no_hide" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, regardless of anything else, I’ve gradually become uncomfortable letting google moderate all aspects of my online life. </p>

<p>So I’m trying to move away from services that I’ve been using for  years. And the sad fact is that the alternatives just <em>aren’t</em> as good as the Google offerings. There’s no getting around it. But here’s what I’m using in my attempt at going Google-free:</p>

<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>

<p>Back to the fox. Firefox was once a shining star of the future of the web and now it’s kind of like Safari: At least it’s not Internet Explorer. But it has plugins like AdBlock Plus <sup id="fnref:block_comments"><a href="#fn:block_comments" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and <a href="http://www.abine.com/how-donottrackme-works/">Do Not Track Me</a>, both of which make it easier to keep anybody from following me around on the internet. Again, if they want to know where I go all day every day they can just <em>ask</em> me (or look at my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:PogiNate">Pinboard</a>), but I’d like them to have the decency to ask.</p>

<h2 id="duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</h2>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> is a great search engine for people who don’t want to be tracked. It stores exactly <em>nothing</em> about you, meaning your searches aren’t tailored or customized based on your past search history. They have a great summary of <a href="http://donttrack.us/">why this is a good thing</a> linked to their home page.</p>

<p>The downside is that, well, you’re not getting customized results, which means that sometimes you have to dig a few pages down to get the content you really want. But the results are quite good and getting better daily. </p>

<h2 id="gmail">Gmail…</h2>

<p>This is the one that’s going to be difficult. Gmail is the king of free email, bar none. To get anywhere close to the feature set that gmail provides is going to require paying for email, and if I’m going to do that I’d like to pay for really <em>really</em> secure email. So I’m still looking for a good replacement. </p>

<p>At first I was put off by the really small quotas most email providers give you. I mean, Gmail is up to 15GB free! A lot of them charge you for anything over 1GB! <strong>GASP!!</strong></p>

<p>But then I looked at my actual usage. I’ve had my gmail account for around 7 years, and I’ve used about .56GB. Yep. Half a gig.<sup id="fnref:inboxZero"><a href="#fn:inboxZero" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> So I’m probably okay on that front. Based on that I’m looking at a few options:</p>

<p>-<strong><a href="http://lavabit.com/index.html">Lavabit</a></strong> is an email provider who values security, security, security. For $8 a year you get 1GB of storage <sup id="fnref:upgrade"><a href="#fn:upgrade" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and <a href="http://lavabit.com/secure.html">totally encrypted email</a>. The price is good, and as I’ve said, I think I can swing a single gigabyte. 
- <strong><a href="https://www.hushmail.com/services/hushmail/features/">Hushmail</a></strong> Gives you PGP signed email…if you are sending to people who know how to open PGP encrypted email. They charge $34.99/year for 1GB of storage, but if you want to use a desktop email client via POP/IMAP you will have to go up to $49.98/year for some reason. 
- <strong><a href="https://www.fastmail.fm/signup/personal.html">FastMail</a></strong> is owned by <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> and is somewhere between Lavabit and Hushmail: it’s $19.95/year for 1GB, no mention of encryption on the server, but fully secure communication between client and server, and no (known) agreement with the NSA. </p>

<h2 id="duckduckgo-xmpp">DuckDuckGo XMPP</h2>

<p>Apparently Google is ending support for the XMPP protocol for Gtalk, which makes it a much less useful chat system. Which is a shame, because a lot of my coworkers use it almost exclusively. </p>

<p>But DuckDuckGo is there for you in this arena as well. They provide <a href="https://dukgo.com/blog/xmpp-services-at-duckduckgo">an XMPP server </a>that is much less Stalker-ish than GTalk, and also isn’t being deprecated in favor of closed protocols.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Google has done a good job of making themselves incredibly useful, and they make some very good apps. In the end it’s a question of how much you’re willing to give them in exchange for those services. I’d still like to believe that Google hasn’t totally abandoned their “Don’t Be Evil” mantra, but it’s still a good idea to check out the competition.  </p>

Working on <a href="http://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a> has been an education for me, and not just about vim. I&rsquo;ve  been working on developing a writing/editing loop that is more sustainable than <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>&rsquo;s joyous abandon, so that I&rsquo;ll actually do some editing. While I enjoy working quickly and just getting things out there in front of people, there&rsquo;s a problem with that model: not only am I terrible typist, I also write some terrible first drafts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385480016/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0385480016&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpnatedicco-20">Anne Lamott</a> would say that&rsquo;s okay; and I agree with her. But the problem is that I&rsquo;m also <em>really bad</em> at revising. Part of my problem is that I&rsquo;m a very good speed reader, which really just means that I&rsquo;m good at skimming over what I consider to be fluff and finding what I consider to be the point of the text in front of me. Good for getting through things quickly, bad for finding mistakes in my own text. </p>

<p>So I needed a way to force myself to slow down and actually look at the words. Not surprisingly it was <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/06/30/mac-app-review-slicereader/">Brett Terpstra</a> that clued me into this simple little &ldquo;one thing well&rdquo; app. With <a href="http://mthr.me/slicereader/">Slicereader</a> I just paste whatever chapter I&rsquo;m working on into the app, and it converts all of my Markdown into nicely formatted text<sup id="fnref:mostly"><a href="#fn:mostly" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and only shows me one paragraph at a time. Meaning I have to actually <em>read</em> that paragraph all by itself. Meaning I have to view it as a single entity, without resting on what came before or after it. Meaning I end up editing <em>every</em> paragraph instantly and repeatedly, reloading the text and seeing how my new changes stand up. </p>

<p>Slicereader is almost disturbingly focused on what it sets out to do: there are no fancy options to twiddle, no settings, no font pickers. You can choose daytime or nighttime mode. But when I need some  help focusing on my editing, having all those choices taken from me is definitely a good thing.</p>

<p>And yes, I&rsquo;ve run this article through Slicereader as well. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I recently put a coupon up on <a href="https://twitter.com/poginate">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://alpha.app.net/poginate">App.net</a> offering ten people the opportunity to get a free copy of my book <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em>, which is still very much in <strong>alpha</strong>. But I figured attracting a few extra readers couldn’t do anything but help. </p>

<p>And in next to no time all ten free copies were gone, which is awesome. I’m not so much about the money on this one, I’m just enjoying writing it and really want to see it published and hopefully help a few people. </p>

<p>Anyway, it occurred to me that I hadn’t offered free copies to any of my faithful blog followers! So, here’s the deal: here’s another coupon code, also good for the first 10, nah, let’s say 20 people, but the condition is that I <em>really</em> would like any feedback you have about the book, even in this early state. Okay, ready? Here’s the skinny:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">https://leanpub.com/painless_vim</a></li>
  <li>buy the book using the coupon code <strong>Blog20</strong>. <sup id="fnref:paymor"><a href="#fn:paymor" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Give me some awesome and useful feedback on the book either through the Leanpub site, as a comment on this site. Or ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/poginate">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://alpha.app.net/poginate">App.net</a> with the hashtag #PainlessVim. However you get the feedback to me I will definitely take it into consideration and use it to improve the book.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m working on <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Painless Vim</a></em> in <a href="www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, because I love its organizational capabilities <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> …or have I mentioned my love of Scrivener before? (yes)</p>

<p>The problem arises when I want to push my text to <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a>. Scrivener has two very good ways to get your text out of Scriv into the world: you can <em>export</em> each text as a file, or you can <em>compile</em> it into a single document ready to send off to a printer. They’ve both got their pros and cons, but to really understand them we need a brief detour into how publishing on Leanpub works:</p>

<h3 id="brief-detour-into-how-publishing-on-leanpub-works">Brief Detour Into How Publishing on Leanpub Works</h3>

<p>to publish your text on Leanpub you put all your chapters or whatever into individual <code>.txt</code> files, which you put into a special Dropbox folder called something like <code>~/Dropbox/name_of_book/manuscript/</code>. then you include a file called <code>Book.txt</code> to tell Leanpub what order the text files should be in when the book is put together. You can also create a <code>Sample.txt</code> file that tells Leanpub which text files to put into a free sample that potential buyers can download, and  a <code>Preview.txt</code> file that lets you just render a specific part of the book to make sure the formatting looks the way you want it. Okay, that’s your brief tutorial on Leanpub.</p>

<p>So, back to getting text out of Scrivener into this folder.</p>

<p>The compile option seems like a great choice at first: it creates a single text file made up of all the text in your document, formatted however you like, and once you’ve created your compile settings it’s a single click operation. </p>

<p>The problem is with the Sample and Preview options. Since your text is all in a single file you can’t pick and choose individual parts of the text to give away for free. You could have two separate compile settings, but that seems very labor intensive.</p>

<p>So, the “export” option is the way to go, right? Every text section in your Scrivener project is exported as a single text file, just like Leanpub wants, you can create <code>Sample.txt</code> and <code>Preview.txt</code> files and everything is good. </p>

<p>Well, one problem. Let’s say  you’ve got your book laid out in Folders instead of as just a list of text files in Scrivener. When it exports your book it creates the full file structure:</p>

<pre><code>Painless Vim
| 
+- Part I
|	|
|	+- Chapter 1.txt
|	+- Chapter2.txt
+- Part II
	|
	+- Chapter 3.txt	 
</code></pre>

<p>And so forth. You get the picture. This is a problem because Leanpub doesn’t do subfolders; you need all the files to be in the root of the <code>manuscript/</code> directory. So, after doing an export from Scrivener I needed a way to flatten out the file system.</p>

<h3 id="enter-automator">Enter Automator</h3>

<p>Here’s the fun part. I could have written a ruby script to go through the exported file and copy all the <code>.txt</code> files to the <code>manuscript</code> folder. But that would have taken <em>minutes</em>. Like, <em>dozens</em> of them. So I decided to once again let Automator have a crack at it.</p>

<p>And it was <strong>easy</strong>. Automator has gotten a lot more useful since last I played with it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, with things like variables and other things you’d expect from a real scripting environment. What’s more, I was able to set up my workflow as a “folder action”, watching the <code>~/Documents/Painless/</code> folder which I created specifically for this purpose. Now I just tell Scrivener to export into that directory and Automator takes it from there. </p>

<p>The Automator workflow I set up is dead simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save the name of whatever just appeared in <code>Painless</code> in a variable called <code>New Folder</code> <sup id="fnref:names"><a href="#fn:names" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> .</li>
  <li>Get everything in the new folder, recursively</li>
  <li>Filter that list by file extension (in this case, we only want .txt files)</li>
  <li>Copy all those text files to <code>~/Dropbox/painless_vim/manuscript/</code>, overwriting any existing files.</li>
  <li>Delete whatever is stored in <code>incoming</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>And there you have it. The last step is just to make the export from Scrivener one step shorter, because it doesn’t have to ask if you want to overwrite your last export.</p>

<p>There are a lot of advantages to this setup. I can now export a single text file or folder instead of the entire project, and just that file will get overwritten. For single file exports this is nearly instantaneous, opposed to the <em>three whole seconds</em> it takes to export my entire project.  I  can also have <em>all</em> my files, including my <code>Book.txt, Sample.txt</code> and <code>Preview.txt</code> managed in Scrivener, which I couldn’t do if I were doing the Compile option. </p>

<p>Over all I’m very pleased with this workflow. It’s taken one of the pain points out of writing <em>Painless Vim</em>. </p>

      <p>Okay, I know it seems odd that I’m writing a book called <em>Painless Vim</em> and here I am admitting that I’m using a completely different editor to write it. What’s the deal here? The deal is that it’s really easy to copy and paste text around between editors (especially using Hog Bay’s <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor">QuickCursor</a>, but that’s an entirely different footnote), and while I do most of the actual writing in vim, I keep the text files in Scrivener for reasons that will be expounded upon in a future blog post.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/painless_cover.png" title="Painless Vim Cover" />
I&rsquo;m excited to announce the availability of <em>Painless Vim</em>, my new (indeed, still in progress) book on the ever powerful vim editor! While the book is still in progress, you can pick up a copy at <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">Leanpub</a> right now and make suggestions to help guide the development of this book. I&rsquo;m very impressed by the Leanpub system, allowing authors to write their books out in the open and get feedback along the way. </p>

<h2 id="why-another-vim-tutorial">Why Another Vim Tutorial?</h2>

<p>I started thinking about writing this book when I realized I <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">wasn&rsquo;t the only developer</a> who has tried to use vim and was put off by the vast majority of vim training available. Vim is really very developer friendly, but a lot of the teaching resources for vim are anything but. My goal is to take the best of what I have picked up in my journey to vim and present it in a way that helps other people get over the initial hurdle and into the good parts of the editor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing quite a bit about the development process of the book and the workflow involved. Watch this space!</p>
