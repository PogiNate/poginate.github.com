Working on [Painless Vim] has been an education for me, and not just about vim. I've  been working on developing a writing/editing loop that is more sustainable than [NaNoWriMo]'s joyous abandon, so that I'll actually do some editing. While I enjoy working quickly and just getting things out there in front of people, there's a problem with that model: not only am I terrible typist, I also write some terrible first drafts.

[Anne Lamott] would say that's okay; and I agree with her. But the problem is that I'm also *really bad* at revising. Part of my problem is that I'm a very good speed reader, which really just means that I'm good at skimming over what I consider to be fluff and finding what I consider to be the point of the text in front of me. Good for getting through things quickly, bad for finding mistakes in my own text. 

So I needed a way to force myself to slow down and actually look at the words. Not surprisingly it was [Brett Terpstra] that clued me into this simple little "one thing well" app. With [Slicereader] I just paste whatever chapter I'm working on into the app, and it converts all of my Markdown into nicely formatted text[^mostly] and only shows me one paragraph at a time. Meaning I have to actually *read* that paragraph all by itself. Meaning I have to view it as a single entity, without resting on what came before or after it. Meaning I end up editing *every* paragraph instantly and repeatedly, reloading the text and seeing how my new changes stand up. 

Slicereader is almost disturbingly focused on what it sets out to do: there are no fancy options to twiddle, no settings, no font pickers. You can choose daytime or nighttime mode. But when I need some  help focusing on my editing, having all those choices taken from me is definitely a good thing.

And yes, I've run this article through Slicereader as well.

[^mostly]:Mostly. It only handles Gruber markdown, meaning no footnotes, etc.
