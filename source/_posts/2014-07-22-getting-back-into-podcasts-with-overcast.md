Back when I first got an iPod Touch I was *way* into podcasts. There were some weirdly terrible ones back then that *changed me*, man. But for a while my biggest reason for listening to podcasts was because I was commuting, and I needed something brain-stimulating while I was on the road. Ever since I moved closer to my worksite, however, I've been doing far less with podcasts, and I realized that I actually miss it. So I decided to get back into it.

My mistake, unfortunately, was that I did some *research* before trying to get back into podcasts. I should have just downloaded the apple podcasts app and gone on from there. But that's not my style. Long story short, I didn't really listen to any podcasts **at all** for a few months while I decided which app I wanted to use. In my wanderings I discovered that Marco Arment of Instapaper fame was making a new podcasting app called [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), which makes me happy, because I have loved Instapaper for years[^untilPocket], and I respect his appreciation for minimal presentation around the content.

So I waited for Overcast to actually come out, again, putting off my dive back into the world o' podcasts. I played with [Downcast](http://downcastapp.com/) for a while, but wasn't in love with it. 

So, Overcast is finally out, and I wasted no time downloading it and getting back into the world of people talking at their computers, and at some point I'll probably get into that in another post[^orNot] .

[^untilPocket]: Until I discovered Pocket. But I wrote about that before. 

[^orNot]: Or not. Short version: Podcasts are quite different than they were eight years ago, mostly quite a bit better.
