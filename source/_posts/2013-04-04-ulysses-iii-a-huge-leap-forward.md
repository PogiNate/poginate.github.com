# Ulysses

I'll admit it, I've had a sick love/hate relationship with [Ulysses][1] for years. I first heard of it by way of [Scrivener][2], my beloved freeform creative writing app. And the Ulysses of then just was not a thing of beauty. The interface had a lot of holdovers from early- or pre-OSX days, and was pretty cluttered (which is quite a statement, given [Scrivener's interface][3]. I love Scrivener, but it's clearly a *tool*…look, I'm off topic again.) and unfriendly. I could see some of the power that was inherent in the product, but it just wasn't for me.

Well, A few days ago Ulysses III released a brand new version, and they **nailed** it. They took the bold step of abandoning everything they'd done before, threw out the interface entirely, and started over. They took a look at what the OSX world is doing now, in terms of interface, and did that. A very finder-like sidebar gives you access to all your text, organized based on where it lives. (iCloud, on your mac, or, if you have the [Daedalus app][4] for iOS, in your Daedalus iCloud folder) Inside each folder you have your texts, (called "sheets", as in "sheets of paper") all of which are auto-saved at all times, so you don't have to worry about hitting `⌘S` all the time. It's a surprisingly slick and easy way to just sit down and *write* without worrying about filenames or sync options of any such things. You just start writing and worry about organization later, once you've got something out there. 

## The Cons
It's not all peaches and light, of course. The developers have pointed out that this is a 1.0 release, even if it *is* called Ulysses III. The app stores its files in `.ulysses` format, which isn't interoperable with tools like Marked, which means its a little harder to get previews of your text post-Markdown-rendering. (It's still quite possible, but not quite easy). It doesn't natively handle [MultiMarkdown][5], but it exports multimarkdown-compatible footnotes. I'm guessing that the `.ulysses` file format is a bundle that wraps up all the images and keywords and notes and whatnot, but it does make interoperability with other apps a little harder. 

But this is a minor gripe, and isn't a flaw so much as a design decision that was clearly made with forethought. They decided that Ulysses was written as a creation app. You can share later, but create your text *first*. 

All in all, I'm deeply impressed with the level of polish and attention that went into the latest version, and I'd recommend you pick it up.
