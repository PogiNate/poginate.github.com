For about the last year I've been working on [*Painless Vim*](https://leanpub.com/painless_vim), and really enjoying it. I've learned a lot about writing, and of course I've learned a lot about vim. But for the last little while it's been slowing down. I've written all the text, and I've been through a few rounds of revisions, both from changes made by editors and from changes suggested by readers. And now it's pretty much done. Sure, there are a few revisions left to make, but they're nothing compared to the work I've been putting into it over the previous months. 

So I decided to write *another* book. You see, I realized that, while I use vim for basically all my programming work, that's only half the story. Vim is great, but there's no real reason to use a terminal based text editor if that's *all* you're doing from the terminal. And for the past year or more, while I've been learning and writing about vim, I've also been using **tmux** to get more out of my terminal, and to compliment and augment vim's power.

So I'm writing a book to compliment and augment *Painless Vim*. 

[*Painless Tmux*](https://leanpub.com/painless_tmux) is brand new, and as I write this it's only 15 pages long. There's a lot of life ahead of it, and I'm really excited about this one. For one thing, tmux is *so much easier* to use and to learn than vim. Especially if you're already using vim. 

Together, vim and tmux let you do pretty much everything, all from the keyboard. so, I'm also offering the [two books as a bundle](https://leanpub.com/b/painless_productivity), for significantly less than buying them separately. Basically if you buy the bundle you get *Painless Tmux* for a dollar. 

When I started *Painless Vim* I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. I figured it would take a month, tops. Well, this time, I *do* know what I'm getting myself into and I'm excited to get into it.
