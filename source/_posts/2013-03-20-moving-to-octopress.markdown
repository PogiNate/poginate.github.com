So hey, I'm moving this blog to Octopress now. I don't need it running on a big ol' WordPress install with all those updates and whatnot; I just want a simple blog that I can update without using any tools more complex than `vim` and `git`. 

More posts to come; also I'll be archiving the entire old site somewhere safe and sound so that anyone who wants to see what I wrote in the past can do so. For now the WordPress site is still up and running [here](http://old.natedickson.com/).
