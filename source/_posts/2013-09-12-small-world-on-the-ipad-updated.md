Just a quick post to happily note that [Days of Wonder](http://www.daysofwonder.com) has finally updated their [Small World app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/small-world-for-ipad/id364165557?mt=8) on the iPad. Small World was the first game I bought on the original iPad, and it's been sadly neglected for a quite a while. 

But it's back in business now! It's beautifully, fully retina, has new content (available through an in app purchase), and now lets you play with up to five people via pass & play, or you can have the one on one experience that you're used to from the original version. I've always loved Days Of Wonder's games, and they continue to do a great job bringing them to the iPad. Thanks guys!
