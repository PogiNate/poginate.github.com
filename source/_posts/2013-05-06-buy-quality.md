I have a [Timbuk2][1] bag that I purchased six years ago, when I got my first MacBook. Even though I only had a 13" [black plastic MacBook][2] at the time, I got the 15" messenger bag because I figured the odds were pretty good that *someday* I would have a 15" MacBook Pro. 

{% pullquote %} 
The 13" MacBook is gone, one 15" MBP has come and gone and a new one now lives in the same pocket of the same messenger bag I picked up all those years ago. That bag has been through airports, camping trips, freezing terrible outdoor IT jobs in the dead of winter and hot terrible outdoor IT jobs in the dog days of summer. Now it's pretty much relegated to hauling my computer back and forth to and from the office because I've left my IT days behind me.  {"But other than a bit of dirt the bag still looks pretty much as good as it did when I bought it. "} The seams are still tight and solid, the velcro still works, the material is still without any frayed or torn spots. The bag cost more than I could afford at the time[^1], but I've never regretted the decision.  I got something that was well made, and I'm grateful.

So, not a big post, or a deep important mystery of life this time around, sorry. Not even a cool new tech toy to play with. My only real point is that if you do some research and find something worth investing in[^2] you will be rewarded for it. 


[^1]:	In fact, it cost more than the second-hand MacBook it was purchased to carry

[^2]:	Time or money; learning vim has been a huge investment of time for me, not so much on the financial side.
