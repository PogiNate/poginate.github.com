I was going through some old scraps of things I've written and found this brainstorming list of possible titles for my  [then-upcoming book on vim.](https://leanpub.com/painless_vim) before I settled on the current title. I kind of like some of these, but overall I think I went for the best one. 

## Vim Book Titles

- Vim in One (Long) Day
- Long Day's Journey into Vim
- Gradual Vim
- Vim for Smart People Who Could Use a Little Help
- Vim for the Wise
- Growing into Vim
- Reluctant Vim
- Painless Vim
- The Sane Person's Guide to Vim
- Vim for the Sane

* * *

I really liked *Long Day's Journey into Vim*, but that cover would have been *hideous* and it didn't really have the "friendly and breezy" vibe I was going for. Ditto *Reluctant Vim*.
