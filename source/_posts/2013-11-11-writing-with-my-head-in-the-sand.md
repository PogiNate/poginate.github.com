There's a saying about marriage that you should find a spouse with your eyes wide open and stay with a spouse with your eyes half shut.[^source] I've found this to be helpful advice about more than just marriage; when I buy a new computer I spend months reading reviews and write ups on the all the components involved and scouring the world for the best prices. Once I buy my components I all but block those sites on my browser; I don't *want* to know that a brand new video card came out the same day my suddenly obsolete one arrives at my door. I just want to be happy with what I bought.

And, in an odd way it's turning out to be true about writing *[Painless Vim](http://leanpub.com/painless_vim)*. There are two books and a few websites that I used quite a bit while I was starting to learn vim, they are somehow on my "okay" list. But any site or book I haven't read yet is now *the enemy*, because I'm afraid they're all better than the book I'm writing and I'll have to die now. There are (at least) [two](https://leanpub.com/VimLikeAPro) [other](https://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway) vim books already on Leanpub.com; I can't look at them too directly lest I discover the only thing my book has that the don't is a whimsical cover. 

And, of course, what does it matter? If other books are better that's fine; I can hope that there are some people out there who will get what they need out of my little book. So I'm keeping my head in the sand a little bit. Some day I'll be done writing *Painless Vim* and I'll be able to read other people's vim books.

There's no real point here; just a little note about how my mind seems to work when I'm mid-book like this.
